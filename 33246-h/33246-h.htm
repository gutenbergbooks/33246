A Sweet Disposition.
</p>
<p class="subhead">
Three grains of common sense, one large heart, one good liver, plenty of fresh air and sunlight, one bushel contentment, one good husband. Do not bring to a boil.
</p>
<p>
GERMAN SOUP.&#8212;Good, fresh beef and some cracked bone are all important for soup making. The stock when nutritious, and properly prepared, forms the basis of meat soups. To make the stock great care must be taken in boiling the meat. Put your meat on in cold water, enough to cover the meat, set on the stove to boil, for four hours, slowly but steadily; never boil very fast. When meat becomes tender, add salt, skim carefully, repeat until no more skum arises. Now if more water is needed, always add boiling water from tea kettle. In adding vegetables, prepare such as one prefers, pick over and wash them, chop them, take out the meat, strain the stock through either a fine strainer or a cloth, return to kettle, drop in the vegetables, boil until tender. Add also the meat after the bone is taken out; cut it up in medium sized pieces. The vegetables give the meat a nice flavor. I use cabbage, carrots, onions, tomatoes, peas, parsley, celery and potatoes. Now for other soups the stock is prepared the same way. Noodle soup may be made and rice soup; the rice to be parboiled; then there are the egg dumplings, or barley, vermicelli, and many other kinds of ways to have a change. Celery or parsley should always be used as it flavors the stock very fine for any kind of soup.
</p>
<p>
POTATO SOUP.&#8212;Now this soup is made of left over meat and the bones of roasts, put them on in cold water and boil slowly; you may also add a little fresh meat; then dice some potatoes, strain the stock and return to the stove, put in the potatoes and some rice, boil until tender, then heat a little grease and fry onions until glazed, add a little flour, brown with onions in grease, then pour the soup into this hot mixture, and let it come to a boil. That is fine.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger. (Demonstration of German Cookery No. 2.)
</p>
<p>
CREAM OF CELERY SOUP.&#8212;Take two celery roots, cut up fine and slowly cook one hour in a pint of water; flavor with a little piece of onion; strain through fine sieve. Mix one tablespoon of butter and two of flour, add one quart of milk and boil twenty minutes. Add a little salt and pepper. Serve with one cup of whipped cream added the last minute.&#8212;Mrs. R. J. Walker.
</p>
<p>
GREEN PEA SOUP.&#8212;One pint or one can green peas, one quart boiling water, one pint milk, two tablespoons butter, one teaspoon salt, one-eighth teaspoon pepper, one half teaspoon sugar, two tablespoons flour. Cook peas in water, scald milk. When peas are soft mash through a strainer, add milk and reheat. Rub flour and butter together, stir into them a little of the soup and turn this mixture into the rest of the soup. Stir till smooth, season. Serve with croutons. To make croutons, cut buttered slices of bread one-half inch thick into one-half inch squares, heat these on a pan in the oven, stirring occasionally. They may be kept and reheated.&#8212;Dorothy Whitehead. Demonstrated in 7th grade Domestic Science lesson.
</p>
<p>
ONION AND POTATO SOUP.&#8212;One and one-half quarts milk (steamed), two large potatoes and two onions chopped real fine, season with butter, pepper and salt. Cook in a stew pan until done. When ready to serve pour together.&#8212;Mrs. John Heffernan.
</p>
<p>
CREAM TOMATO SOUP.&#8212;One can of tomatoes put through a sieve, season with butter, pepper and salt; thicken with two tablespoons flour, bringing to a boil. Steam one and a half quarts milk in double cooker, just before serving, pour together, stirring with a spoon.&#8212;Mrs. John Heffernan.
</p>
<p>
SOUP STOCK.&#8212;Two soup bones, one of mutton and one of beef, (cracked to get the good of them), one onion chopped fine together with two tablespoons sugar, brown in kettle, stirring to keep from burning. Add meat bones, turning them over a few times. Pour in four quarts cold water, add one carrot, chopped fine, and bay leaves. Boil slowly three hours, strain and season to taste. Any vegetable may be added to this.&#8212;Mrs. John Heffernan.
</p>
<p>
MOCK OYSTER SOUP.&#8212;To one can tomatoes add two quarts milk, tablespoon butter, salt and pepper. (Steam milk in double cooker.) Stew tomatoes in sauce pan, season, and when ready to serve pour together.&#8212;Mrs. John Heffernan.
</p>
<p>
CHICKEN GUMBO SOUP.&#8212;Fry a chicken, remove bones and chop chicken fine. Put in a kettle with two quarts boiling water, three large ears of corn cut from cob, six tomatoes sliced, twenty-four pods of okra cut up. Fry the corn, tomatoes and okra brown in the chicken drippings first, then add to the water and chicken with two tablespoons rice, pepper and teaspoon salt. Simmer one hour.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead. Southern Cookery demonstration.
</p>
<p>
MULLAGATAWNAY SOUP.&#8212;Cut four onions, one carrot, two turnips and one head of celery into three quarts of liquor in which one or two fowls have been boiled; keep it over a brisk fire till it boils, then place it on a corner of the fire and let it simmer twenty minutes. Add one tablespoon of currie powder and one tablespoonful of flour; mix the whole well together and let it boil three minutes; pass it through a colander. Serve with pieces of roast chicken in it. Add boiled rice in a separate dish. It must be of good yellow color and not too thick. Half veal and half chicken will answer.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
BOUQUET OF SWEET HERBS.&#8212;Two sprigs of parsley, two bay leaves, two sprigs of thyme, two of summer savory and two of sage. Tie the dried herbs with the parsley. Nice for seasoning soups and stews.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
BOILED POTATO DUMPLINGS.&#8212;Grate several potatoes, add salt to taste, a little nutmeg, one egg and some bread crumbs browned in butter, a little flour and milk, add enough flour and milk so as to handle and make in balls. Drop into boiling salt water. When done brown some bread crumbs in butter and put over dumplings when on platter.&#8212;Mrs. Paul Leonhardy.
</p>
<p>
DUMPLINGS.&#8212;Two cups of flour, two teaspoons baking powder, one-half teaspoon salt, one cup sweet milk. Stir and drop from a spoon into chicken broth or boiling meat. Let boil fifteen minutes with cover off and put cover on and boil five minutes.&#8212;Mrs. A. McKay.
</p>
<p>
NOODLES.&#8212;Four eggs well beaten, one tablespoon water, 2 cups flour, one-half teaspoon salt. Work and knead together and roll out in very thin sheets; let them dry; roll up like jelly roll and cut into very fine strips; then drop into boiling salted water and boil ten minutes; or they may be boiled in soup and served with it. If wanted as a separate dish drain them in a colander and turn them into a dish. Fry bread crumbs in butter a light brown and turn them over the noodles and serve. These noodles can be fried in grease instead by cutting the sheets into strips two inches wide and four inches long, and dropping them into hot grease. Lift out and dredge with sugar. Both very nice.&#8212;Mrs. Paul Leonhardy.
</p>
<p>
OYSTER SOUP.&#8212;Heat one quart of milk with two large tablespoonfuls of butter. Heat a solid pint of oysters in enough water to cover them. Add one large teaspoonful of salt and a good deal of pepper. As soon as the oysters get plump and the gills "ruffle" add them to the hot milk. Stir in a cupful of crushed cracker crumbs and serve in soup plates or bowls, with oyster crackers.&#8212;Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
RAISED DUMPLINGS.&#8212;Soak a cake of compressed yeast in a cup of lukewarm milk, together with a tablespoonful of sugar and a teaspoonful of salt. Sift a pint of flour into a bowl and stir into it a cupful of milk, an egg and the soaked yeast and work all thoroughly, adding gradually flour for a soft dough. Do not get it stiff. Cover the bowl and let the dough rise until it has doubled the original bulk. Flour the kneading-board and mold the dough into small biscuits. Let these rise for half an hour. Butter a large, round pan and set your dumplings within it, brushing each with melted butter on top. Pour in enough milk to reach halfway to the top of the dumplings. Set upon a brick in the oven and bake to a light brown. Eat with vanilla sauce or prunes.
</p>
<p>
NO. TWO.&#8212;Proceed as with No. 1, but instead of baking in the oven, put the dumplings into a steamer, not too close together. Allow for swelling. Cover with a close lid to keep in the steam. These may also be served with vanilla or with prune sauce.
</p>
<p>
NO. THREE.&#8212;Have ready a large kettle of boiling water, slightly salted, and after shaping the dumplings drop them carefully into this. Leave plenty of room to swell and puff. Or they may be steamed in clear soup. If you like you may try all of these recipes and still have enough dough left for a pan of biscuits.

Fish, Oysters and Shell Fish
</p>
<p class="head">
"He was a brave man who first ate an oyster."&#8212;Dean Swift.
</p>
<p>
FISH.&#8212;With the possible exception of salmon, fish is a less nutritious article of diet than flesh meat, and yet it fitly supplements the latter. The oily and coarser grained species is more nutritious than the white, or finer grained but not so easily digested. A fish is in good condition when its gills are bright clear red, its eyes full and the body firm and stiff. Before cooking they should be well washed in cold water and kept in salt water for a short time, but they should not be allowed to stand in water for any length of time and should be kept upon ice until wanted. Small fish are usually fried or boiled, all large fish to be boiled should be wrapped in a cloth and tied closely with twine, steaming is preferable to boiling. Salmon, bluefish, halibut and shad are very palatable baked in cream. Mackerel is best broiled and should be broiled upon the skin side first; other fish first on the inside. In boiling fish, let simmer gently as hard boiling breaks them; time, eight minutes to a pound, sometimes longer.
</p>
<p>
BAKED FISH.&#8212;Clean and wipe dry a white fish or any good sized fish, stuffing made like that for poultry, but drier. Sew it up and put in a hot pan with drippings and a lump of butter; dredge with flour and lay over the fish a few thin slices of salt pork or bits of butter. Bake half hour, basting occasionally.
</p>
<p>
BOILED FISH.&#8212;All fresh fish, except salmon should be placed in salted cold water for boiling. If placed in boiling water the outside would cook much sooner than the inside. A little vinegar added to the water in which fish is boiled improves the flavor. Put the fish in the kettle with the back bone down, to three or four pounds of fish put a small handful of salt. Boil the fish gently until you can draw out one of the fins easily. Most varieties of fish will be well done in twenty or thirty minutes, some in less time. Serve with drawn butter, with hard boiled eggs sliced, or if preferred, milk sauce.
</p>
<p>
BAKED WHITE FISH WITH TOMATOES.&#8212;Take a white fish or trout that will weigh about three pounds, clean, rub with salt and pepper inside and out. Lay a piece of salt pork, not too fat, in the flesh, put in a covered baking dish and turn over it one pint of stewed seasoned tomatoes, cold tomatoes left over are nice. Bake about forty minutes.
</p>
<p>
SCALLOPED SALMON.&#8212;Place in a baking dish a layer of cracker crumbs, then a layer of salmon, then another layer of cracker and salmon, ending with a layer of cracker. On this pour two cups of milk, one egg whipped. Add salt, pepper and butter size of an egg. Bake.

</p>
<p>
OYSTER COCKTAIL.&#8212;A small oyster is used, five or six being alloted each person. For six persons mix together three teaspoons each of vinegar, grated horseradish and tomato sauce; six teaspoons of lemon juice and one of Worcestershire sauce. Have the oysters very cold. Put an equal amount of the prepared sauce over the oysters in each glass. The glass should be placed upon a plate. Serve with an oyster fork and small spoon. This is the prevailing way of serving oysters as a first course.&#8212;Mrs. R. J. Walker.
</p>
<p>
OYSTERS a la BECHEMEL.&#8212;Melt three tablespoonfuls of butter and blend it with two tablespoonfuls of flour, add one large cupful of thin cream or milk and cook thick.

</p>
<p>
OYSTER SAUTE.&#8212;Drain select oysters, heat pan hot and brown butter in it. Just cover the bottom of the pan with large oysters as soon as the butter sizzles and is piping hot. When brown on under side turn and brown well. Season with salt and pepper. Add butter as needed and turn the oysters and butter sauce on to prepared toast points. Heat the dry pan again, add butter and when hot brown more oysters in it. The butter must be hot and only a few oysters should be browned at a time.
</p>
<p>
OYSTERS AND BACON BAKED.&#8212;Butter a roast pan and lay large plump oysters in a layer on the bottom of it. Season to suit taste with salt, pepper and lemon juice and lay three thin slices of bacon over the top. Roast brown in a quick oven. Serve on toast with tomato sauce, if liked, or with cream sauce. A piquant bake is made by mixing finely chopped green apples with the oysters before baking.
</p>
<p>
PIGS IN BLANKETS.&#8212;Wrap each large oyster in a thin strip of bacon and fasten with a tooth pick, bake in a quick oven until bacon is crisp and oysters plump. Sometimes they are broiled over clear coals.

</p>
<p>
OYSTERS IN CELERY SAUCE.&#8212;Clean and cut celery into small pieces and cook until tender in boiling salted water. Rub enough of the soft celery through a colander to make a cupful. In a saucepan melt a tablespoonful of butter and mix smoothly into it a heaping tablespoonful of flour. Add a cupful of hot milk and cook until creamy; add the soft celery and half a pint of oysters, add more salt if needed, one-eighth teaspoon of pepper and a few drops of lemon juice; cook until the oysters curl, when the filling is ready for the ramekins. Serve hot.
</p>
<p>
DEVILED OYSTERS.&#8212;Butter scallop shells and put into each five oysters with their own liquor and sprinkle with a drop of Tobasco, a little tomato catsup and a quarter-salt-spoonful of salt and cover with fine cracker or bread crumbs. Scatter a few bits of butter here and there on the oysters and set the shells in a hot oven. Serve on doily covered plates.
</p>
<p>
KIPPERED HERRING.&#8212;Rinse herring in warm water, dry and put on tin or agate plate in hot oven 15 minutes; then pour over a little melted butter, cover and leave in 5 minutes more. This should be served on small pieces of toast.
</p>
<p>
FINNAN HADDIE.&#8212;Put a piece of butter the size of a walnut in pan and when hot add two cupfuls of finnan haddie picked fine. Add one cupful of cream or milk into which one tablespoonful of flour has been rubbed smooth. Let come to a boil and when cooled a little add a dash of pepper and the well beaten yolk of an egg. Serve on toast.
</p>
<p>
SCALLOPED OYSTERS.&#8212;Roll one pound and a half of crisp crackers fine. Butter a deep baking dish and spread a layer of crackers an inch deep. Spread over them a dozen oysters in their liquor, sprinkle a generous half teaspoon salt and a dash of pepper over them, dot with bits of butter, (about two tablespoons) and pour in half a cupful of milk, then add another layer cracker crumbs, oysters, etc., and proceed until one quart of oysters and one and one half pounds of crackers are used. Cover the top with cracker crumbs, dot generously with butter and pour on the remaining milk and oyster liquor. Use altogether about one and one half pints of milk to this quantity of oysters and crackers. Bake about one hour or until crumbs are well browned and oysters plump.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
SAUCE FOR OYSTER PATTIES.&#8212;One cupful of solid oysters. Melt two large tablespoons of butter in a stew pan, blend in two heaping tablespoons of flour and rub smooth; add one scant pint of cream or rich milk; stir until smooth and thick. Drain the oysters and add them with one level teaspoon of salt and a good dash of pepper. When the oysters are plump remove to back of range and stir in the beaten yolks of two eggs mixed with a little cream. For canned oysters add one large teaspoon of curry powder before serving. Serve in pattie shells of baked pastry or in timbal cases or on buttered toast.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
OYSTER PIE.&#8212;Line a baking dish with rich pastry, either pie crust or biscuit crust. Put one quart of oysters in a double boiler with one cup of milk, and two thirds cup of butter and steam until oysters are plump. Slice six hard boiled eggs, mix with one half cupful of cracker crumbs and a cupful of sweet cream; add one full teaspoon of salt and a generous sprinkling of pepper. Mix with the prepared oysters and fill the lined baking dish. Cover with the top crust and bake about twenty minutes in a hot oven or the pastry shell may be baked separately if preferred and filled with the cream. The thickened, creamed oyster patty filling makes a good filling for oyster pie, also it may be served with steamed dumplings or small baking powder biscuits.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
FRIED OYSTERS.&#8212;Select large, fresh oysters. Drain them and season with salt and pepper. Roll bread crumbs that have been crisped in the oven very fine and then sift them. Dip each oyster in the prepared crumbs and then into beaten egg and again into the crumbs. Heap the crumbs in thick little piles and roll the oysters in them until a nice thick crust is formed over each oyster. Have an iron kettle or skillet filled two inches deep with smoking hot lard, lay the oysters in a nice frying basket, if you have one, and plunge it into the hot grease. Cook until nicely browned. Drain and serve hot with lemon points, tomato catsup or any preferred sauce.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
SALMON TIMBALES.&#8212;One can salmon, flaked, add the beaten yolks of three eggs, two tablespoons of thick cream, one teaspoon of lemon juice, salt and pepper and lastly cut in the stiffly beaten whites of the eggs.

WILD DUCK ROASTED.&#8212;Prepare as for roasting the same as any fowl, parboil for fifteen minutes with an onion in the water to remove the strong flavor. A carrot will answer the same purpose. Stuff with bread crumbs, a minced onion, season with pepper and salt, a little sage and a good supply of butter, roast until tender. Use butter plentifully in basting. One half hour will suffice for young ducks. If bread crumb dressing is not liked, sliced apple stuffed in the duck is very nice.&#8212;Mrs. A. McKay.
</p>
<p>
TO PREPARE VENISON.&#8212;Wash clean, dry well with clean dry cloth, salt, pepper and dredge with flour, cut long gashes into roast, place in gashes strips of salt pork or bacon; lay strips on top; place in a bake pan with a very little water, cover roast until nearly done, take off cover, baste and brown slightly.&#8212;Mrs. A. McKay.
</p>
<p>
BROILED PRAIRIE CHICKEN.&#8212;After dressing lay on ice for a few hours, then divide in halves, again divide the thick sections of the breast, sprinkle with salt and pepper and lay the pieces on a gridiron the inside down. Broil slowly at first. Serve with cream gravy and currant jelly.
</p>
<p>
PRAIRIE CHICKEN (STEAMED AND BAKED).&#8212;Stuff them with a dressing of bread crumbs and seasoning of pepper and salt, mixed with melted butter, sage, onion or summer savory may be added if liked. Secure the fowl firmly with a needle and twine. Steam until tender, then remove to dripping pan; dredge with flour, pepper and salt, and brown delicately in oven. Baste with melted butter. Garnish with parsley and currant jelly. Above game recipes given in American Cookery demonstration by Mrs. A. McKay.
</p>
<p>
BROILED VENISON STEAK.&#8212;Venison steaks should be broiled over a clear fire, turning often. It requires more cooking than beef. When sufficiently done season with salt and pepper, pour over two tablespoonfuls of currant jelly, melted with a piece of butter. Serve hot on hot plates. Delicious steaks, corresponding to the shape of mutton chops are cut from the loin.&#8212;Mrs. C. C. Mackenroth.
</p>
<p>
ROAST VENISON.&#8212;Rub the saddle or haunch of venison with a damp cloth and then rub in butter. Make a thick paste of flour and water and spread it an inch thick on the roast. Lay a buttered coarse wrapping paper or one of the new cooking paper bags over the roast and put the meat in the roasting pan with one cupful of hot water. Lift the paper and baste every fifteen minutes with melted butter and hot water. Roast in a hot oven until the meat is tender, then remove the paper and the coat of paste. Dredge the meat with flour, one teaspoonful of salt and pepper and baste with pan drippings and butter until meat is nicely browned. Add a pint of hot water to the drippings and thicken with flour for a gravy. Add a pinch of cloves, nutmeg and mace and stir in a glass of currant jelly until it is dissolved. Strain and serve with the meat. Venison cooked this way will be moist instead of dry and hard.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
ROAST PRAIRIE CHICKEN.&#8212;Have chicken skinned and put in cold water at least three hours, then wipe dry and stuff with bread crumb dressing. Put in roaster and dot with bits of butter and two or three slices of bacon, one onion pricked with three cloves, add several pepper and all spice kernels and a teaspoonful of salt and one cupful of water. Roast about one and one half hours and baste occasionally.&#8212;Mrs. J. Bruegger.
</p>
<p>
ROAST WILD DUCK.&#8212;It is best to keep wild ducks a few days after they are killed if the weather is cold. As most wild duck have the flavor of fish, therefore it is advisable to parboil them, with a carrot in each duck, before roasting, as this absorbs all the unpleasant taste. An onion has the same effect, but when onion is used in dressing the carrot is preferable. Roast the same as tame duck and use dressing for stuffing fowl with a little onion added; bake about one half hour in very hot oven, carefully turning them, baste them and add a little water if necessary. A few slices of bacon roasted with it adds to the flavor of wild game. Serve hot with the gravy it yields. The canvas back duck requires no spices or flavors to make it perfect, as the meat partakes of the flavor of the food the birds feed upon, which is wild celery, and this delicious flavor is best preserved when roasted quickly with a hot fire.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger.
</p>
<p>
PRAIRIE CHICKEN OR SQUAB PIE.&#8212;After the chickens are picked and drawn as a large fowl is for roasting, wash them and put them in a saucepan with a close cover; they should be covered with boiling water and boiled slowly till tender, when a little salt and an onion and cloves should be added; then take them out, drain and dry, and put in each squab a teaspoonful of butter, a little pepper, salt, minced parsley and thyme; then put into the cavity of each chicken a hard boiled egg; lay them in a large baking dish three or four inches deep; strain over them the liquor in which they were simmered, add teaspoonful of butter, one teacup of milk or cream; sift in two tablespoonfuls of cracker crumbs, put in a few slips of parsley, cover with a rich crust and bake.&#8212;Contributed.

<p>
ROAST TURKEY.&#8212;Select if possible a young turkey, carefully remove all feathers and singe it over a burning paper on the stove, then see that it is carefully drawn and no internals broken; remove the crop carefully; after the head is cut off, tie the neck close to the body, by drawing the skin over it, now wash the inside of the turkey in several clean waters, into the next to the last add a teaspoonful of baking soda, this is to destroy that sour taste which fowls often have, if not freshly killed. After a thorough rinsing and washing of the bird wipe dry both in and outside with a clean cloth, rub the inside with salt, then stuff the body and breast with dressing for stuffing fowls, then sew up with strong thread, rub it over with a little soft butter, sprinkle over some salt and pepper, dredge with a little flour, place in a roaster with a little water and cook from two to two and a half hours, turn it around occasionally so that every part will be browned alike, when it appears done, pierce with a fork and when the liquid runs clear, the bird is done. Serve with cranberry sauce. Garnish with parsley, or fried oysters.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger.
</p>
<p>
DRESSING FOR STUFFING FOWL.&#8212;For an eight or ten pound turkey use about three pints of stale bread crumbs, put into a dish and pour tepid water over it, (not hot for that makes it heavy) let stand for a few minutes, then take up a handful and squeeze dry with both hands, put into another dish and when all is pressed dry toss it up lightly through your fingers, this process makes it very light. Parboil the liver, heart, and gizzard, in a little stew pan. When tender mince very fine and add to the bread, now one teaspoon of salt, a little pepper, half cup of melted butter; peel and chop one cooking apple, two tablespoons of green or dry fine minced parsley; mix well, add one beaten egg, mix again and it is ready for either turkey or chicken. For goose or duck add a few slices of onion chopped fine. The water in which the heart, gizzard and liver were stewed may be used with the gravy of the roast turkey, goose, duck or chicken.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger.
</p>
<p>
ROAST GOOSE.&#8212;The goose should not be more than eight months old, and the fatter the more tender and juicy the meat. After the goose has been well washed, cleaned and wiped, rub a little salt inside, stuff with the dressing for stuffing fowls with a little onion added to the dressing. Do not stuff too full and stitch the openings firmly to keep the flavor in and the fat out. Place in roaster with a little water and bake about two and a half hours, carefully turning it frequently and baste with water and salt. When done with all parts evenly brown, take up, pour off the fat and to the brown gravy left, add a little water, and some flour to thicken, bring to a boil and serve in a gravy boat. Garnish goose with parsley.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger.
</p>
<p>
VIRGINIA FRIED CHICKEN.&#8212;Dress and cut up chickens, rub each piece with salt and pepper, then dip it into beaten egg, then into flour and fry brown in deep hot fat or butter and lard mixed, or bacon drippings. Cover the skillet and let chicken cook slowly after it is browned well to be sure it is done. Remove chicken to platter and turn out part of the drippings. Add cooking spoon of flour to remaining drippings and cook a minute, then add milk or cream to make gravy. Season with salt and pepper and just before serving add beaten yolk of one egg mixed with a little milk. Serve with chicken. Garnish chicken platter with slices of cold boiled ham or crisp bacon, and corn dodgers and you will have a typical "Old Dominion" dish. I got above recipe from a Virginia woman.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
SMOTHERED CHICKEN.&#8212;Split a young chicken down back, season with salt and pepper and put in roaster with one cup hot water. Roast (covered) until tender. As it begins to brown make a paste of two tablespoons each of butter and flour, blended, and spread it over chicken, basting often with pan dipper. Add cupful cream to drippings in pan for gravy. If the chicken is large cut into pieces as for frying before roasting this way.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
CREOLE STEWED CHICKEN.&#8212;Boil a pint of rice in two quarts of water until half done, then add a cut up fowl with one minced onion, blade of mace, four large mushrooms or half a can, half a chili pepper, teaspoon salt and three or four small tomatoes cut up and one tablespoon butter. Stew gently until chicken is tender, stirring often and adding hot water as needed. Serve in baked pastry shell or on toast. Mrs. Whitehead. Above chicken recipes were demonstrated in Mrs. Whitehead's paper on Southern Cookery.
</p>
<p>
SWEDISH DUCK FILLING.&#8212;One quart of bread crumbs, four good-sized apples, one half cup of browned butter, cinnamon, raisins, and currants to taste. Stuff fowl.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
DAIRY LUNCH CHICKEN SANDWICH.&#8212;Make a thin batter of one and one half pints of water, one pint of milk, one egg, scant half teaspoon of soda, one tablespoon of salt, dash of pepper and flour enough to mix like pan cake batter. Cut a young chicken into quarters, dip it in the batter and fry brown in deep fat. Serve between slices of bread. Garnish with dill pickles.&#8212;Mrs. T. A. McKay.
</p>
<p>
CHICKEN CROQUETTES.&#8212;One cup of the white meat of boiled fowl packed in solid, then chopped fine and mashed till like fine powder. Add one half level teaspoon salt, one half saltspoon paprika, or white pepper. Make one pint thick cream sauce, with two level tablespoons butter and two heaped tablespoons of cornstarch cooked together, diluted with one pint of hot cream, and stirred till very smooth and thick. Season with one half teaspoon salt and one half saltspoon pepper. Stir as much of the hot sauce into the chicken as it will take up and enable you to handle the mixture in shaping, remembering that the sauce will be much thicker when cold, and so the mixture may be quite soft. The meat varies greatly in its power to absorb the sauce, therefore it is impossible to give an exact amount but if the sauce is thick a large portion may be used and the croquettes will be all the more creamy for it. When cold, shape a tablespoon of the mixture into a ball, then into a cylinder, roll in fine dry bread crumbs, beaten egg diluted with water, then crumbs again, and fry one minute in deep, smoking hot fat. More of the delicious flavor of the meat will be retained with this simple seasoning of salt and pepper than with a variety of condiments.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CREAMED STEWED CHICKEN.&#8212;Cut up fowl as for fricassee, put over the fire in enough cold water to cover it well. Bring gradually to a boil. When it begins to bubble, add a stalk of celery, some chopped parsley, and a bay leaf. Simmer until tender before seasoning. Make a white sauce in a frying pan of two tablespoons butter cooked with the same quantity of flour. As soon as well mixed stir into this a large cupful of strained and skimmed gravy from the pot, have ready one half cup cream, heated with a pinch of soda, add this to the thickened gravy, very slowly so as not to curdle. Do not boil after cream is in. Cook dumplings in the gravy left, after the reserved cupful and chicken are taken out.
</p>
<p>
DUMPLINGS FOR CHICKEN STEW.&#8212;In a pint of flour, sift a heaping teaspoon baking powder, one fourth teaspoon salt, sift flour twice, now rub in a tablespoonful of shortening, and wet with enough milk to make a dough that can be rolled out. Cut into rounds and drop into the boiling gravy. Should be done in ten minutes.&#8212;Mrs. Paul Leonhardy.
</p>
<p>
CREAMED CHICKEN.&#8212;Three pounds of chicken boiled tender in salted water and freed of bones, skin and gristle. Cut the meat into small pieces. Boil two sweet breads tender in salted water with the juice of half a lemon. When tender, drain and throw them into cold water to blanch; then free from skin and gristle and cut into small pieces; drain a can of French mushrooms and cut them into quarters. Make a cream sauce of two tablespoons of butter, melted and blended with two tablespoons of flour, add one pint of hot thin cream, one teaspoon of salt, juice of one lemon, and juice pressed from half a small onion, and a dash of pepper, cook thick but remove from fire and add one beaten egg yolk mixed with one cup of whipped cream. Add to the heated chicken, mushrooms and sweet breads. Mix well and serve in patty shells, or timbales. (The whipped cream may be omitted.) For escalloped chicken turn the above mixture into a buttered baking dish, cover with fine rolled bread crumbs, dot with butter and bake until well browned. Reserve the chicken broth for soup or make a gravy of it and serve with baking powder biscuit or dumplings.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CROQUETTES.&#8212;Cook one large tablespoon of butter with two tablespoons of flour, add one cup milk or cream, one teaspoon onion juice, one teaspoon salt, dash of pepper and nutmeg and one beaten egg. Mix with one cup of minced meat or chicken, form into croquettes after the mixture has stood an hour. Fry brown in deep fat after rolling in egg and bread crumbs.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
HOT TAMALES.&#8212;Cook a three pound chicken tender in salted water to cover. Chop chicken meat fine and return bones to the kettle. Cut open six large chilli peppers or chillies, wash, cut out seeds and cut into halves. Cover with boiling water and cook until soft and press through a fine sieve. Brown a golden color two medium sized chopped onions in hot butter, add the chilli pulps with half a cup of chicken broth, cover pan and cook slowly fifteen minutes. Put one quart of corn meal into a bowl and pour over it enough hot chicken broth to make a dry paste; work with the hands into a soft but not wet paste. Have broad six inch long corn husks soaked until pliable in warm water. Open these and down the center of each put a wide strip of corn meal paste; mix the chopped chicken with the chilli mixture and spread it on the corn meal paste down the center; roll up the husks, fold in the ends and tie with narrow strips of husks. The corn meal must surround the chicken mixture. Lay the prepared tamales carefully on top of the bones keeping them above the broth. Sprinkle with a teaspoon of salt and cover the kettle and cook steadily one hour, being careful that the broth doesn't boil over the tamales. For the novice, it is easier to steam the tamales over the broth in a flat covered steamer. Serve very hot in the husks. Minced beef may be used instead of chicken and often one cup of chopped tomatoes are added to the chillies before cooking.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CHILE-CON-CARNE.&#8212;Cook chillies as in tamale recipe, add to the sieved chillies one pint of thick strained tomato pulp, one minced large onion, one fourth teaspoon salt and cover and simmer fifteen minutes. Cut dark meat from a boiled or roasted chicken, into small pieces or use small pieces of cooked veal, cover with the chilli sauce and stew slowly one hour or stand over hot water and steam about an hour or until chicken has practically absorbed the sauce.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CHILLI MINO PAN CAKES.&#8212;Make a light fritter or pan cake batter and fry cakes in hot olive oil or butter shaking them until they are set. Spread these cakes with chicken and chilli mixture (as prepared for tamales) roll up the pan cakes, pour over more of the sauce, sprinkle with grated cheese and serve immediately.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
RICE AND CHICKEN CON-CARNE.&#8212;One pint of stewed chicken cut up in chicken broth and seasoned with three cooked chillies (sieved) half a cup of washed rice, half a pint of finely minced cooked tongue, one teaspoon of salt. Stir often and cook until rice has absorbed most of the broth but do not let it scorch. Serve with half a pint of strained tomato cooked with one tablespoon of butter and a little salt.&#8212;Contributed.

</p>
<p>
TO JUDGE GOOD BEEF.&#8212;Good beef, if young, will be of a bright red color, fine grained and firm to the touch. The fat of a clear straw color with a little of it through the muscles, giving the meat a marbled appearance. The suet should be dry and crumbly and of a darker shade than the fat. In old beef both flesh and fat will be darker, much coarser in fiber and decidedly dry compared with young beef. If the beef is of a pale, dull color, and flabby, it is not well matured; if very dark and colored and coarse grained with deep yellow fat it will be found tough and tasteless and if it bears greenish tints and feels slippery on the surface it is already stale and unfit for use. When meat is tough add a little vinegar or a piece of lemon to the water in which it is boiled. This will result in a shortening of time and a saving of fuel, while the meat will be rendered more easy of digestion; also any slight taint that may be about the meat will be entirely removed by this process. A pinch of baking soda can be used instead of lemon or vinegar.
</p>
<p>
POT ROAST.&#8212;Take a nice piece of the round beef weighing about four pounds, season well with salt and pepper and dust over thoroughly with flour. In a flat bottomed kettle melt a piece of butter the size of an egg, when hot put in the meat, turning until well browned on every side. When roast is brown add a little onion, six cloves, six allspice and enough boiling water to come up half way to the top of the meat. Cook slowly for three hours. When done take out meat, add one tablespoon of flour to a little cold water to thicken gravy.

MARYLAND BAKED HAM.&#8212;Soak a ham over night in cold water and boil it tender in sweet cider or water, putting it on in enough liquid to cover. It must be tender but not broken. Remove the rind, outline the fat on top into diamonds, placing a clove in each. Rub half a cup of maple syrup into ham, sprinkle with pepper, place in oven and brown, sprinkling with sifted bread crumbs if liked. Serve hot or if sliced cold, lay plate and heavy weight on ham over night to make nice firm slices.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead. Southern Cookery demonstration.
</p>
<p>
LULA'S CORNED BEEF.&#8212;Five pounds rump beef or sirloin, five tablespoons salt, three tablespoons brown sugar. Saltpetre size of a hickory nut. Dissolve the ingredients in enough water to cover the beef, and let the meat stand in the brine twenty four hours. Boil meat in the same brine three and a half hours. Quick, simple and good as it gives the purchaser a chance to select the cut of meat she prefers for corning.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
SPICED BEEF LOAF.&#8212;Two and one half pounds of round steak put through a food chopper, with one fourth pound of salt pork; one teaspoonful of dried and rolled bread crumbs; two scant cupfuls of milk, one beaten egg, one teaspoon of butter; one teaspoonful of salt; one half teaspoon each of cinnamon, cloves, mace and allspice, a dash of cayenne pepper. Mix into one large loaf and lay in a buttered roasting pan. (I use two individual bread tins using one loaf hot for dinner and reserving the other to slice cold.) Add a cupful of hot water to each baking pan; sprinkle sifted bread crumbs over the meat and dot with butter. Bake covered until brown and tender basting often but do not cook until hard and dry. Serve with the gravy or hot tomato sauce, horseradish or mayonaise.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.

<p>
FAAR I KAAL. NORWEGIAN.&#8212;Get twenty cents worth of leg of mutton, cut in small pieces. Put in the kettle one layer of mutton, one medium sized head of cabbage cut into six pieces, four potatoes, cut in halves, two medium sized carrots, quartered. Between each layer of meat and vegetables add salt, whole peppers and a little flour. Set the kettle on the stove and add about one quart of water. Let boil slowly for at least three hours. When done remove from fire and serve. This will serve three people.&#8212;Mrs. R. Meidell.
</p>
<p>
ROUND STEAK STEW.&#8212;Take one and one half quarter pounds of round steak and pound it well, roll in flour and fry (same as any other steak) over this pour one pint of boiling water, season with salt, pepper and a little onion. Let stew one hour or until tender.&#8212;Mrs. R. Meidell.
</p>
<p>
STEAMED VEAL LOAF.&#8212;Take two pounds raw veal, grind, two teaspoons salt, one fourth teaspoon pepper, butter size of an egg, one cup freshly grated bread crumbs, two eggs, two tablespoons milk, knead until well mixed. Butter baking powder cans, coat with bread crumbs, fill compactly with the meat, put on cover, stand in kettle of water almost to the top of the mold. Boil steadily one and one half hours. When cool remove from molds at once. Can be eaten hot.&#8212;Mrs. Paul Leonhardy.
</p>
<p>
JELLIED VEAL OR CHICKEN.&#8212;Three pounds of stewing veal shank or chicken, one tablespoon of chopped onion, one tablespoon chopped celery; one level teaspoon of salt, dash of pepper. Cover with water and boil steadily until the meat is very tender and liquor reduced. Remove the meat from the liquor, free it from gristle and bones and chop fine. Strain the liquor, stir it through the meat and pack in a square mold, laying a heavy weight on top. Serve it cold, cut in thin slices and garnished with sliced hard boiled eggs, sliced lemon or pickled beets.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
SCRAMBLED CALF'S BRAINS.&#8212;Soak two pounds of calf's brains in strong salt water one hour. Then carefully remove all membrane and blood clots. Dip the brains in flour and fry brown in hot drippings, bacon preferred. Hash the brains with a knife and scramble four fresh eggs with them, season with salt and pepper, tossing well together with a knife until nicely browned. Serve with toast or hot buttered rolls or baking powder biscuit.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CROWN OF LAMB WITH CURRIED RICE BALLS.&#8212;Have the marketman prepare the rack of lamb for a "crown" roast by scraping the flesh from the ribs half way down, joining the rack together and fastening it firmly. Sprinkle with pepper and salt, wrap the ribs in oiled paper and roast in a brisk oven. Baste often and allow fifteen minutes to each pound. Garnish with rice balls made as follows: Steam one cupful of rice until tender. Make two cupfuls of sauce by melting two tablespoonfuls of butter, adding one teaspoonful currie powder, one saltspoonful of onion juice, and two tablespoonfuls flour, and stock, or water and milk, and one half teaspoonful of salt. Cook until smooth, then add sufficient sauce to the rice to form into balls; reheat them in a steamer, dip them in the sauce which has been kept warm and fill the crown.
</p>
<p>
MINT JELLY.&#8212;Is a toothsome accompaniment to roast lamb, and is a novel variation to the customary mint sauce. Soak one cupful of chopped mint in one pint of water for one hour. Strain, heat to the boiling point and pour over one half box of gelatin which has been softened in half a teacup of cold water. Add three tablespoonfuls of sugar, four tablespoonfuls lemon juice and a saltspoonful of salt. Pour into molds and set in a cold place to harden. Turn out on chilled saucers just before serving.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
TONGUE IN PORT WINE.&#8212;Boil a beef's tongue until it is tender enough to stick a fork through; put it in cold water and remove the skin; set it away until cold; save the water in which it was boiled and put it on the stove with four small onions and two small carrots, boil until the vegetables are tender, then remove the carrots and mash the onions into pieces; brown two tablespoonfuls of brown sugar, add it to the liquor, with a level teaspoonful each of allspice, cloves and mace, and pepper and salt to taste. Blend two tablespoonfuls each of butter and flour, thicken the liquor with this and add three quarters of a cup of port wine. Split the tongue lengthwise, put it in the liquor and heat thoroughly, and serve with the sauce.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
SYRIAN STEW.&#8212;To be eaten with boiled rice. Neck of mutton will do nicely for this. Separate the fat from the lean meat. Mince the fat and melt it in frying pan. Cut the lean meat into chunks about a cubic inch, more or less, in size, and fry in a hot fat. Have at hand an earthen cooking vessel; remove the meat from frying pan when done and drop into the earthen vessel. Have ready the vegetables, also cut into chunks (not slices), and brown in the fat, removing them as they brown and putting them with the meat. Next, slice two large or four small Spanish onions (slicing not into rings, but first into halves, lengthwise; next slicing each half lengthwise), and fry until well done (sprinkling them with salt hastens the process). Add these to the meat and vegetables, then add a cupful of canned or fresh tomato and a small quantity of water, seasoned with salt and that brown pepper which is more spicy than hot; let it come to a boil and simmer gently. It should be begun two hours before mealtime. Any vegetable will do. Vegetable marrow is excellent, but this should be allowed to steam for awhile with the meat and onions before the tomatoes are added and cooked without water. For potatoes, add a few cloves or a small piece of cinnamon bark to flavor. Celery stew is excellent and cabbage also is good; but for either of these omit the tomatoes and add some lemon juice shortly before removing from fire. Such vegetables as celery, cabbage and haricot beans should not be browned in the fat, but stirred about for awhile in the cooking vessel with the meat and onions, and thus fried slightly before adding the water. There is an infinite variety of these stews, all on the same principle.
</p>
<p>
BOILED RICE.&#8212;To accompany Syrian stew.&#8212;A double boiler is not necessary. Wash the rice until the water is clear, removing any foreign grains or dirt. Have ready in a saucepan double the quantity of boiling water that you have of rice, in which has been melted a lump of butter. When the water boils hard drop in the rice, add a rounded teaspoonful of salt to every cup of rice and boil gently, uncovered. Do not stir. For very hard rice allow two and one half cups of water to a cup of rice. You will soon learn just the quantity required. By the time the water dries out the rice should be done and each grain firm and separate. Allow a generous teaspoonful of butter to each cup of rice. One cup is sufficient for two persons. When the water gets low, taste the rice, and if you find it is still hard add a little more boiling water, or cover and remove to the back of the stove to finish slowly.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
HOME MADE SAUSAGE.&#8212;Grind six pounds of raw lean fresh pork and three pounds of raw fat pork to a pulp. Put it in a large graniteware pan and add twelve teaspoons of powdered sage, six teaspoons of ground black pepper, six teaspoons of dry salt and one teaspoon each of ground cloves, allspice and nutmeg. Mix the seasoning well into the meat and pack it into stone jars, as closely as possible. Pour melted lard or paraffine wax over the top, which will be all the protection it will require. All winter as wanted make it into small cakes and fry brown.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
HEAD CHEESE.&#8212;This is made of the head, ears and tongue of a pig. Boil them after cleaning them, in salted water until tender. Strip the meat from the bones and chop (not grind) very fine. Season with salt, pepper, sage and powdered cloves, to taste; then add one cup of good vinegar. Mix all together thoroughly and pack hard into molds or bowls, interspersing bits of the tongue cut into oblongs and triangles an inch in length. Wet a plate and press down on the top of each mold and place a weight on top of that. In two days it will be ready to eat. If you desire to keep it several weeks you can turn it out of the molds and immerse in cold vinegar in stone jars. This will preserve it admirably and you have only to pare away the outside if too acid for your taste.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
PHILADELPHIA SCRAPPLE.&#8212;Take a cleaned pig's head and boil until the flesh slips easily from the bones. Remove all the bones and chop fine. Set the liquor in which the meat was boiled aside until cold, take the cake of fat from the surface and return the liquor to the fire. When it boils, put in the chopped meat and season well with pepper and salt. Let it boil again and thicken with corn meal as you would in making ordinary corn meal mush, by letting it slip slowly through the fingers to prevent lumps. Cook an hour, stirring constantly at first, afterwards putting back on the range in a position to boil gently. When done, pour into a long, square pan, not too deep, and mould. In cold weather this can be kept several weeks. Slice and saute in butter or dripping.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
MUTTON ROAST.&#8212;Just cover the breast of mutton with water, adding a little salt. Set over the fire, and when it comes to a boil place over a more moderate heat and simmer for three hours. Then take it up on a platter, draw out the bones, make a stuffing of bread crumbs, parsley, thyme, salt, pepper and a little melted suet or butter; lay this on the meat, roll it up and fasten with skewers. Cover thickly with egg and bread crumbs and bake in a good oven fifteen minutes to each pound of meat. When it begins to brown baste frequently with the pan drippings. Serve on a bed of cress.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
FRIED HAM WITH CREAM SAUCE.&#8212;Trim off the edges; put into a hot pan with one teaspoonful of drippings, put over hot fire and keep turning the ham. Never put into pan and fry on one side before turning. You must keep turning constantly. When nice and brown on both sides remove to a hot platter. Put one tablespoonful of flour into pan, mix well and add one cup of cold milk slowly, stir and boil three minutes. Pour over ham.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
HAM JELLY.&#8212;Mix two cupfuls of boiled ham, chopped and pounded very fine, with one teaspoonful of French mustard, a good dash of cayenne, one teaspoonful of granulated gelatin dissolved in one half cupful of hot water (with a teaspoonful of beef extract if at hand), and finally with one half cupful of cream which has been whipped. When thoroughly blended press into a wet square mold and place on ice for two or three hours. It will keep for a day or two. When ready to serve cut in thin slices and put on each a teaspoonful of mayonnaise dressing in which a little freshly grated horseradish and whipped cream have been stirred. Two tablespoonfuls of mayonnaise, four tablespoonfuls of whipped cream and one tablespoonful of horseradish will be the right proportions.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
GOULASH.&#8212;Use two pounds of lean beef cut into neat pieces; chop an onion, half a carrot and one eighth of a green pepper; place all in a kettle with two cups of stock, or water will do, cover and stew gently for two hours; add five small sour pickles in the kettle with the meat, a teaspoonful of salt; continue to stew for half an hour longer. Remove the meat on a hot platter, place the pickles around the meat, thicken the gravy with a little flour and water and pour the gravy around the meat.
</p>
<p>
JELLIED VEAL.&#8212;One or two knuckles of veal boiled until very tender in water to cover. Strain the juice and cut the meat into small pieces or chop fine, season with salt, pepper and a little powdered sage; put back into strained broth and boil until nearly dry. Add juice of one lemon and turn into a mold, press well and let it stand until cold and firm. Slice in thin slices. For pressed beef use minced parsley instead of sage and omit the lemon juice. For pressed chicken omit the parsley and sage, add the lemon juice to the chicken broth and mould with a layer of sliced hard boiled eggs placed in the center of the loaf.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
PORK PATTIES.&#8212;One cup chopped pork, two cups bread crumbs, two beaten eggs and one half cup milk, season with butter, salt and pepper, (and sage if liked). Fill buttered gem tins and bake until nicely brown.&#8212;Mrs. A. McKay.
</p>
<p>
CREAMED DRIED BEEF.&#8212;Pick half a pound of chipped dried beef into small pieces and bring it to a boil in water to cover. Drain, add one tablespoon of butter and dredge with one large tablespoon of flour, add two cupfuls of milk or cream and cook thick. Season with pepper. Nice for breakfast or lunch. Make creamed codfish the same way.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
HAMBURG HASH.&#8212;One pound hamburg steak, two tablespoonfuls butter, eight or ten potatoes, one small onion, one small bunch parsley, one teaspoonful celery salt, half teaspoonful common salt, paprika for seasoning, half cupful hot water. Having all these things chopped and ready, melt the butter in a frying pan and toss the onion about in the pan until it becomes colored. Add the chopped beef and stir it until it has become nicely browned. Add the hot water, stirring thoroughly; then add the potatoes, parsley, paprika and salt. Stir about until well cooked. Turn out on a hot dish and serve promptly, garnished with parsley.
</p>
<p>
CORN BEEF HASH.&#8212;Make like above hamburg hash but use cold, chopped cooked corn beef and omit the onion and celery salt.

"It is not what we intend, but what we do that makes us useful."&#8212;H. W. Beecher.
</p>
<p>
TOMATO SAUCE.&#8212;Take a quart can of tomatoes, put it over the fire in a stew pan, put in one slice of onion, add two cloves, a little pepper and salt, boil about twenty minutes; then remove from the fire and strain it through a sieve. Now melt in another pan an ounce of butter, and as it melts sprinkle in a tablespoonful of flour, stir it until it browns and froths a little. Mix the tomato pulp with it, and it is ready for the table. Excellent for mutton chops and roast beef.
</p>
<p>
TOMATO SAUCE.&#8212;Melt one tablespoon of butter, rub in one tablespoon of flour, half teaspoon salt, a little pepper, add one pint hot milk, cook until well done, stirring all the time to keep it smooth. Pass a few stewed tomatoes through the sieve to remove seeds, enough to give thirteen teaspoons for the sauce. Stir in just before serving. Serve with fish by pouring a few spoonfuls over each piece.
</p>
<p>
CREAM SAUCE.&#8212;Put two tablespoons butter in a pan, add two tablespoons flour, mix well together, pour on gradually one cup scalded milk, stirring all the time, one quarter teaspoon salt and a little white pepper. Cook thick.
</p>
<p>
CREAM SAUCE.&#8212;One tablespoon flour, half pint of cream or milk, one tablespoonful of butter, half teaspoonful of salt, dash of pepper. Melt the butter being careful not to brown it, add the flour, mix until smooth then add the cream or milk, stir continually until it boils; add salt and pepper, and use at once. If you are not quite ready to use it stand over boiling water to keep warm, stirring often to prevent a crust forming on top.
</p>
<p>
HOLLANDAISE SAUCE.&#8212;For baked or boiled fish. One half cup butter, yolks of two eggs, juice of half a lemon, one saltspoonful salt, quarter saltspoonful cayenne pepper, one and one half cups boiling water. Rub the butter to a cream in a bowl with wooden or silver spoon, add the yolks, one at a time and beat well, then add lemon juice, salt and pepper. About five minutes before serving add boiling water, place bowl in saucepan of boiling water and stir rapidly until it thickens like boiled custard. Pour the sauce around the fish.
</p>
<p>
HORSE RADISH SAUCE.&#8212;Grate sufficient horseradish to make four good sized tablespoonfuls, add this to half pint of salad dressing and serve with cold beef.
</p>
<p>
SALMON SAUCE.&#8212;One cup of milk, heated to boiling point and thickened with a tablespoonful of corn starch, the oil from salmons, one large tablespoonful of butter, one egg well beaten, juice of one lemon, cayenne pepper to taste. Add the egg to the thickened milk when you have stirred in the butter and oil. Take from fire, season and let stand in hot water three minutes covered, then put in lemon juice and turn over salmon immediately. Note: Above recipes for sauces were demonstrated by Mrs. A. McKay at Domestic Science club.
</p>
<p>
HORSERADISH SAUCE.&#8212;Add to six tablespoonfuls of grated horseradish the yolk of one egg and half a teaspoonful of salt. Mix thoroughly; add a tablespoonful of good vinegar and then carefully a quarter of a cupful of cream whipped to a stiff froth. If the horseradish is already in vinegar omit the tablespoonful of vinegar and press dry the horseradish. This is one of the nicest sauces to serve with cold mutton or with hot corned beef.
</p>
<p>
HORSERADISH CREAM SAUCE.&#8212;Beat one tablespoonful of cream until stiff. As cream begins to thicken add gradually three-fourths teaspoonful of vinegar. Season with a few grains of salt and a dash of paprika, then fold in one half tablespoonful of grated horseradish root.
</p>
<p>

Bread and Rolls
</p>
<p class="head">
"The loaf is, after all, the thing that's most essential."&#8212;J. W. Foley.
</p>
<p>
WHITE AND RYE BREAD.&#8212;While boiling potatoes I save the potato water, about one pint. After it is cooled and only luke warm, I soak in it one cake of yeast foam, one teaspoonful of sugar and a small pinch of ginger, and then let it dissolve until supper time; then take a quart of wheat flour and mix with a little warm water, or water and milk, and add your yeast so that the sponge will not be too thin, but like a stiff batter. Let it stand over night in a warm place to raise. Next morning I divide the sponge, using two thirds of it for wheat bread and one third for rye bread, as you can bake six loaves of bread from one cake of yeast; four of wheat and two of rye. To the two thirds part of sponge I take two quarts of wheat flour, one tablespoonful of salt and water enough to make quite a stiff dough. For the rye bread one quart of rye flour with one and one half cups of wheat flour and one teaspoonful of salt. Knead it same as for wheat bread, then let it raise again and when it has doubled in size, it is ready for the tins and after raising there until light, it is ready for the oven in which if hot it will bake in from three fourths to one hour. Before putting it in the oven, I usually wash it with luke warm milk to give it a nice brown color while baking.&#8212;Mrs. John Bruegger. Demonstration of German Cookery, breads and cookies.
</p>
<p>
GERMAN COFFEE CAKE.&#8212;Next comes German coffee cake and rolls. I set the sponge with one cake of yeast as for bread and mix it the next morning with two cups of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, two tablespoons of lard, three eggs, grated rind and juice of one lemon, a little nutmeg, a teaspoonful of salt, add two quarts of white flour, and knead with milk and water, not quite so stiff as for bread. Let it raise two hours after which put it in tins and let raise again; then melt butter and spread on coffee cake and sprinkle with sugar and cinnamon, and it is ready for the oven and ought to be quickly baked. From this dough you can bake quite a variety, for instance, one dozen rolls, two plain coffee cakes, one dozen raised doughnuts and one loaf cake. For the loaf cake you add one cupful of raisins, a little chopped citron, almond extract, one egg and a little butter, beat well with a spoon and fill in a sponge cake tin and let it raise before putting it in the oven to bake, then bake three quarters of an hour.&#8212;Mrs. John Bruegger. German Cookery demonstration.
</p>
<p>
RYE BREAD.&#8212;To one pint of water (luke warm) add one cake of yeast foam, one teaspoon salt, two tablespoons sugar, and one medium sized boiled potato. Mash this fine and mix with the salt and sugar in the water; let this stand until evening, then add enough well sifted flour to make a stiff batter. Set in a warm place to rise over night. Next morning add one quart of luke warm water, one heaping teaspoon salt, one quart of white flour, and two quarts of rye flour all well sifted, and work all together, then knead for ten minutes, adding a little flour from time to time until it ceases to stick to the fingers or mold board, then put into a large bread pan and set in warm place to rise again, until light, then knead again, and make into loaves. Put into well greased bread pans, let raise and bake from one to one and a half hours. When done take out and brush lightly with melted butter or drippings.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger.
</p>
<p>
WHITE BREAD.&#8212;Scald one pint of milk with three tablespoons of lard then put in bread pan with one quart of warm water; add two tablespoons sugar, two tablespoons salt. Stir in flour to make a thick batter one yeast cake that has been soaked well in water. I make sponge after dinner and let set till evening then mix into a large loaf; let stand till morning. Before breakfast knead into loaves. This will make from three to four loaves of bread.&#8212;Mrs. Southard.
</p>
<p>
GRAHAM BREAD.&#8212;Make the yeast sponge as above but add one half cup cooking molasses and a little more sugar. Do not make sponge too thick with white flour. Mix in evening, with graham flour but not quite as stiff as white bread. Graham bread is very slow to raise.
</p>
<p>
DATE BREAD.&#8212;One cup of chopped dates, two cups milk, one third cup sugar, one fourth yeast cake, one fourth cup luke warm water, one half teaspoon salt, five cups of sifted flour. Mix and knead like bread and bake in loaves.
</p>
<p>
POCKET BOOK ROLLS.&#8212;Warm one quart new milk, add one cup butter or lard, four tablespoons sugar and two well beaten eggs. Stir in flour enough to make a moderately stiff sponge. Add a small cup of yeast and set in a warm place to rise, which will take three or four hours, then mix in flour enough to make a soft dough and let rise again. When well risen dissolve a lump of soda, size of a bean, in spoon of milk and work into the dough and roll into sheets one half inch thick. Spread with butter, cut into squares and fold over, pocket book shape. Put in tins, let rise a while and bake.&#8212;Mrs. L. L. Lampman.
</p>
<p>
ROLLS.&#8212;Take two teacupsful of light sponge. Add to it one half cup shortening, one cup of sugar and two cups of warm water. Mix with flour and knead but do not make a very stiff dough. Let raise all day. In evening form rolls and let them raise all night. Bake in moderate oven.&#8212;Mrs. Harry Hanson.
</p>
<p>
RAISED BISCUITS.&#8212;One cup of flour scalded with generous pint of hot potato water. (Boil potatoes and drain water for this). When cold add one cake of yeast dissolved in luke warm water. Mix this at noon and let it stand, uncovered, until night, then add one pint of warm water and enough flour to make a light sponge, beating well. Let stand until morning in a warm place or in a covered bread pan well wrapped to retain the heat. Add to this sponge in the morning one small cup of sugar, two eggs and one half cupful lard and a generous tablespoon of salt. Mix stiff with flour. Let stand until light then knead well, let raise an hour and knead again and make into biscuits. Put in greased baking pans and let raise until very light. Bake in a moderate oven.&#8212;Mrs. George W. Newton.
</p>
<p>
ALMOND WREATH.&#8212;Two ounces of flour; two cakes of yeast; one pint of luke warm milk; a tablespoonful of salt. Mix into a light sponge and let it rise all night. In the morning add six ounces of butter and the same of pulverized sugar, six eggs, one pint of rich cream and enough flour to make a soft dough. Let it rise again until very light. Then roll out with few and swift strokes of the rolling-pin into a sheet less than half an inch thick and cut into strips. Braid these into a coronet about some round object in the center. Or you may make it into a round cake if you like. Shell half a pound of sweet almonds, blanch and shred them and dry in the oven for a few minutes. Then mix them with granulated and coffee sugar and cinnamon and strew over the cakes when you have washed the surface with white of egg to make the mixture stick. Bake in a moderate oven. This quantity will make at least six large cakes.
</p>
<p>
YEAST.&#8212;Three heaping tablespoons flour, two of salt, two tablespoons of sugar. Pour one dipperful of boiling water on this and add twelve mashed potatoes. Add cold water enough to cool for yeast. Add one yeast cake which has been soaked one half hour in tepid water. Use half of this for one baking.&#8212;Mrs. A. McKay.

<p class="head">
"What an excellent thing did God bestow on man when He gave him a good stomach."&#8212;Beaumont and Fletcher.
</p>
<p>
FRITTERS.&#8212;Beat four eggs very light. Do not separate yolks and whites but beat together about five minutes; add one scant cupful of milk, one small teaspoon of salt and just a dash of baking powder (about as large as a small bean). Quickly whisk in enough sifted flour to make a thin pan cake batter. Beat smooth. Drop by spoonfuls into deep smoking hot lard and fry like doughnuts. Drain, and serve immediately with maple syrup, honey or jelly sauce.&#8212;Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
SOUTHERN WAFFLES.&#8212;Mix together one scant pint of sifted flour and one generous pint of milk until smooth; add one half cupful of melted butter and the well beaten yolks of three eggs; then the well beaten whites and one half teaspoon of salt. Just before baking add two teaspoonfuls of baking powder and hot lard. Bake in a hot, well greased waffle iron and serve immediately with butter and maple syrup or honey.&#8212;Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
PAN CAKES.&#8212;For a family of six, take one quart of butter milk or of slightly clabbered sour milk. Beat into it two level teaspoons of soda and one small teaspoon of salt. Add the beaten yolks of two eggs and then enough flour to make a smooth batter, not too stiff. If too thick add a little more milk. Lastly add one tablespoon of melted butter and the stiffly beaten whites of eggs. Rub the smoking hot griddle with a piece of suet fastened to a skewer or fork, drop butter on by tablespoonful and bake the cakes a nice brown, turning once. Serve immediately on hot plates. These cakes may be served with butter and syrup or they may be spread with jam or jelly and rolled. Using half flour with half corn meal makes good corn cakes or half graham flour for graham cakes.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
CORN OYSTERS OR CORN FRITTERS.&#8212;Grate eight large ears of corn, or split each row of corn down the center and scrape out all of the pulp. Beat the yolks of two eggs, add them to the corn pulps with half a teaspoon of salt and the beaten whites of eggs and then add enough rolled cracker crumbs to make a thick batter. Fry oyster shape, in deep, smoking fat and put in the oven to crisp while the balance of the cakes are frying. Do not use flour to thicken the batter. The crackers are much nicer and give the true oyster flavor. These are made from fresh, green corn, only.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
CORN DODGERS.&#8212;Put one cup of corn meal, one half teaspoon of salt in double boiler; add one cup boiling water; beat smooth and add one tablespoon butter. Cook and steam covered for one hour.

</p>
<p>
HOE CAKE.&#8212;Put one quart of white corn meal in a bowl; add one teaspoon salt, add sufficient boiling water to just moisten, stirring all the time, beating to stiff batter. Moisten hands in cold water and make corn meal into small round cakes. Bake on plank in front of open fire three quarters of an hour or fry slowly on griddle. When done pull apart, butter and send to table hot.
</p>
<p>
BEATEN BISCUIT (VIRGINIA).&#8212;Three pints pastry flour mixed with one cup lard; one teaspoon salt, mix together like pie crust. Make into stiff dough with milk or milk and water mixed, and knead well; beat or pound with a rolling pin or mallet one hour. The dough should be smooth and glossy and bits should break off with a snap. Shape in thin, flat cakes. Pick all over with a sharp fork and bake until a delicate brown and until the edges crack a little. Must bake thoroughly or they will be heavy in the middle.
</p>
<p>
JOHNNY CAKE OR CORN BREAD.&#8212;One cup corn meal, one half cup flour, two small teaspoons sugar, two tablespoons butter, or drippings, one beaten egg; salt; one cup of sour milk; one level teaspoonful of soda dissolved in a bit of hot water.

Beat it until very nice and smooth. Pour it into a small cup just large enough to hold the timbale iron. Heat the timbale iron in the hot fat for about ten minutes, then lower it into the batter about one inch, turn it partly over as you take it out so the cases will not slip off, then plunge the iron into the fat and when browned slightly lift it up, and drain and slip the cup from the iron. When all are fried fill the cases with any delicate meat, game, fish or oysters, cut small and warmed in a rich cream sauce.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>

<p>
PANCAKES.&#8212;Two cups flour, two cups milk, two teaspoonfuls sugar, two teaspoonfuls baking powder, one teaspoonful salt, one tablespoonful melted butter, two eggs beaten separately.

Sandwiches
</p>
<p class="head">
"There is no higher art than that which tends toward the improvement of food."&#8212;Henry Ward Beecher.
</p>
<p>
Bread for sandwiches should be at least one day old. Cut into thin slices of uniform size, remove all crust and then cut into the desired shape either with the sharp, pliable knife or a sharp cookie cutter. The butter should be soft enough to spread smoothly and the most essential thing is to have good bread and fresh sweet butter. Meat for filling should either be sliced very thin or chopped fine and other ingredients minced or mashed to make as smooth a paste as possible and mix evenly with the salad dressing or other dressing used. Sandwiches are better eaten as soon as made. If necessary to let them stand an hour or so, wrap the plate of sandwiches in a dampened napkin and put in a cold place so the bread will not become hard and dry. Be careful not to let the dressing run over the outer edge of the slices of bread. Sandwiches must be dainty to be appetizing and easily handled. Cut the slices as thin as you can and make into small triangles or squared sandwiches, or oblong ones two or three inches long.
</p>
<p>
SANDWICHES.&#8212;Mince the white meat of a roast chicken, and mix it with half a can of French mushrooms, chopped fine, and a half cupful of chopped English walnuts. Season to taste with melted butter. Put the mixture between slices of whole wheat bread.
</p>
<p>
WALNUT SANDWICHES.&#8212;Shell English walnuts. Blanch and chop, and to every tablespoonful of nuts allow a good half teaspoonful of cream cheese. Rub well together and spread on thin slices of crustless white or graham bread.
</p>
<p>
DEVILED EGG SANDWICHES.&#8212;Mash the yolks of hard boiled eggs to a powder and moisten with olive oil and a few drops of vinegar. Work to a paste, add salt, pepper and French mustard to taste, with a drop or two of tabasco sauce. Now chop the whites of the eggs as fine as possible or until they are like a coarse powder and mix them with the yolk paste. If more seasoning is necessary, add it before spreading the mixture upon sliced graham bread.
</p>
<p>
ROAST BEEF SANDWICHES.&#8212;Chop rare roast beef very fine, taking care to use only the lean portions of the meat. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and a saltspoonful of horseradish. Mix and make into sandwiches with thinly sliced graham bread.
</p>
<p>
PEANUT SANDWICHES.&#8212;Shell and skin freshly roasted peanuts and roll them to fine crumbs on a pastry board. Add salt to taste and mix the powdered nuts with enough fresh cream cheese to make a paste that can be easily spread on unbuttered bread. Keep in a cold, damp place until wanted.
</p>
<p>
STUFFED EGGS.&#8212;Boil eggs hard and throw them into cold water. When cool remove the shells, cut the eggs in half carefully and extract the yolks. Rub these to a powder with the back of a spoon and add to them pepper and salt to taste, a little melted butter to make the mixture into a smooth paste. If ham is not at hand any other cold meat will do, and either anchovies or anchovy paste may be used. Make the compound into balls about the size and shape of the yolks and restore them to their place between the two cups of the whites.
</p>
<p>
HAM AND OLIVE SANDWICHES.&#8212;Chop lean ham fine and beat into each cupful of the minced meat a tablespoonful of salad oil, a teaspoonful of vinegar, a saltspoonful of French mustard, six olives chopped fine and a teaspoonful of minced parsley. Work all to a paste and spread on thin slices of white bread.
</p>
<p>
SALMON SANDWICHES.&#8212;Small can salmon, one small onion chopped, two hard boiled eggs chopped, and chopped celery to taste. Mix with a good mayonnaise dressing and spread between thin, buttered slices of bread.&#8212;Mrs. L. L. Lampman.
</p>
<p>
HAM SANDWICH.&#8212;Run boiled ham through the food chopper or mince it very fine. This may be spread plain on buttered bread or it may be mixed with the ground yolks and whites of hard boiled eggs and mixed with mayonnaise dressing to a paste and spread between thin slices of buttered bread.
</p>
<p>
ROLLED SANDWICHES.&#8212;Cut the crust from a loaf of bread lengthwise of the loaf in thin slices. Butter, spread with the ham mayonnaise paste and roll up like jelly roll, pressing firmly together. Cut in slices like jelly roll cake slices.
</p>
<p>
NUT BREAD SANDWICHES.&#8212;These are made of nut bread slices spread with butter. Raisin bread also makes nice sandwiches and so does date bread.
</p>
<p>
ENGLISH SANDWICHES.&#8212;Spread toasted muffins (cold muffins cut into slices and toasted) with butter, then with cottage cheese or grated cream cheese. Cover with a thin layer of plum (blue damson preferred) marmalade, and cover with top slice of toasted muffin.
</p>
<p>
SARDINE OR ANCHOVY SANDWICHES.&#8212;Mix ground yolks of five hard boiled eggs with three boned sardines or anchovies, mashed, two small pickles or as many capers chopped, one teaspoon of butter. Spread between thin slices of buttered graham bread.
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
OIL MAYONNAISE.&#8212;Mix the yolk of one raw egg, one half teaspoon of salt, a little mustard and a few grains of cayenne, add one cup of oil in small portions, and two tablespoons lemon juice.

</p>
<p>
FRENCH DRESSING.&#8212;With many people the French dressing is usually hit or miss. There is, however, a set formula that ensures having the proportions right every time. Put into a bowl or bottle a half teaspoonful salt, and a salt spoonful of pepper. Add four tablespoonfuls olive oil, stir with a fork or shake it in a bottle. Add one tablespoonful of lemon juice or vinegar, mix thoroughly and pour over the salad. Tarragon vinegar may be substituted in whole or part of the cider or white wine vinegar.&#8212;Contributed.

</p>
<p>
CHICKEN SALAD.&#8212;Cut cooked chicken into dice and add half as much diced celery. Mix with half of salad dressing and pour the balance over it at serving time. Dressing: Yolks of four eggs, one teaspoon of salt, one heaping teaspoon of sugar, one teaspoon mustard, one cup weak vinegar and speck of cayenne. Cook thick in double boiler. When cold add one cup of whipped cream.&#8212;Mrs. W. S. Davidson.
</p>
<p>
SHRIMP SALAD.&#8212;One can of shrimps, wash thoroughly, then pick to pieces; two cups cabbage sliced fine; two cups chopped celery, one cup English walnuts cut quite fine. Mix together and serve with salad dressing.

Cut potatoes in cubes, remove bones from herring and cut in small pieces or pick to pieces, add onions and let stand on ice till ready to serve, cover with sweet cream and season with salt and pepper.&#8212;Mrs. Schollander.
</p>
<p>
POTATO SALAD.&#8212;I do not know much about salads different from the every day style, with the exception of an old fashioned German potato salad. Boil your potatoes with the jackets, peel and slice while hot; heat bacon drippings in which glaze onions which must be cut very fine, then add flour, brown, add diluted vinegar, let it come to a boil, cool, add a little sweet cream, turn it over your potatoes, which were previously seasoned with pepper and salt. Garnish with either sliced or chopped hard boiled eggs and green parsley.
</p>
<p>
STRING BEAN SALAD.&#8212;Cut ends of tender green beans, string them, cut them either lengthwise, or just break them, boil until tender, add salt, drain. Slice onion very fine, mix with beans, season with pepper, and another pinch of salt, pour diluted vinegar over them, turn diced fried bacon quite hot over this mixture.
</p>
<p>
CABBAGE SALAD OR DUTCH SLAW.&#8212;Select a nice clean cabbage, slice very fine, something like sauer kraut; place in a stew pan, pour boiling water on, let stand for half hour, then drain, slice onion fine, mix with cabbage, season with salt and pepper, turn over this hot bacon grease, with bacon dices in diluted vinegar. Above vegetable salads were given by Mrs. Bruegger in her German Cookery demonstration.
</p>
<p>
BEET AND CHEESE SALAD.&#8212;Make cottage cheese into balls, stick on either side half English walnut. Slice small sweet beets and put two cheese balls and three beet slices on lettuce leaf. Keep on ice until just before time to serve. Add French dressing just before serving. This is a simple salad and so tasty that you will be sure to like it.
</p>
<p>
FRENCH DRESSING.&#8212;Mix three teaspoonfuls of cider vinegar with three and one half tablespoonfuls of olive oil, one large pinch of salt, one tiny pinch of black pepper and red pepper.
</p>
<p>
TOMATO SALAD.&#8212;Choose smooth, red tomatoes, peel; cut into halves, set on ice. Dip each piece into vinegar, lay on lettuce leaf. Drop a spoonful of mayonnaise on each and garnish with nasturtiums.&#8212;Mrs. R. J. Walker.
</p>
<p>
SPINACH SALAD.&#8212;Chop cold boiled spinach fine, season well with salt and pepper, and a little nutmeg and mould into small cups. When cold and formed, turn out on lettuce leaves and garnish with hard boiled eggs sliced or the yolks of hard boiled eggs run through a ricer. Serve with mayonnaise. Strips of Spanish red peppers may be used for garnishing in place of the eggs. The nutmeg can be omitted if distasteful, but most people find it an attractive addition.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
SHRIMP AND TOMATO SALAD.&#8212;Add to the contents of one can of shrimps, an equal amount of crisp white celery cut in small pieces. Mix with a cream or mayonnaise dressing. Place a thick slice of tomato on a crisp lettuce leaf, and a mound of the salad mixture on the tomato. Decorate with a few stuffed olives on each serving, and top with a spoonful of the mayonnaise. If ripe tomatoes are too expensive or not obtainable at this season the salad may be served on tomato jelly cut in thick slices or else molded in the form of cups.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
TOMATO JELLY.&#8212;To make the tomato jelly salad, soak a quarter cupful of gelatine in the same amount of water. When softened put into a sauce pan with a cupful of strained tomato, a quarter cupful cold water, a teaspoonful of salt, the same amount of onion juice, a tablespoonful of tarragon vinegar, and a quarter teaspoonful of white pepper. Stir over the fire until the gelatine is dissolved, but not a moment longer, turn at once into egg cups or small molds and set away to harden. Serve on lettuce leaves with mayonnaise.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
TOMATO SALAD WITH MAYONNAISE.&#8212;Have as many hallowed out tomatoes or molded tomatoes as there are guests to serve and set each in a crisp lettuce leaf. Upon this lay half of an egg that has been deviled and with this three little silvery sardines. Sprinkle with pieces of green pepper, cut fine and dress with mayonnaise.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
FANCY EGG SALAD.&#8212;Select perfect lettuce leaves and arrange in circles on a large platter or on individual plates. Cut hard boiled eggs into halves, remove the yolks and cut the whites into petals shaped like water lilies. Arrange these strips in the center of the lettuce leaves (which simulate lily pads) to form a circle, leaving a small circular opening in the middle. Then put in a second row of petals, placing the pieces between those in the first circle. Lastly press the egg yolks through a ricer, heaping them in the center of the white petals, to represent the heart of a lily. Pass a bowl of mayonnaise with the salad or heap lightly on the surface.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
POTATO SALAD.&#8212;Boil six medium sized potatoes in jackets, until done but do not let them break into pieces. They should be firm and dry. Peel them and cut into thin slices or small dice; mix with two small onions chopped and two hard boiled eggs, sliced. Mix thoroughly with boiled salad dressing, after dressing the potatoes first with lemon juice or vinegar and salt. Let stand on the ice an hour or more. Garnish the salad bowl with shredded lettuce, diced, boiled or pickled beets or radish roses or olives, sweet peppers or any favorite garnish.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
FRENCH DINNER SALAD.&#8212;The dinner salad should always be delicate and light. Heavy meat or fish salads are reserved for luncheon or buffet suppers, where they form the main dish of the meal. The most popular dinner salad is lettuce dressed with oil and lemon juice or vinegar. Cress is often used and of late years bleached dandelions are much in favor. Sliced cucumbers and onion, or sliced tomatoes with shredded lettuce or chopped celery, and the typical spring salad of shredded lettuce, sliced young onions and sliced radishes are all liked. In France the French dressing of oil and vinegar or lemon juice is always used but in America many prefer the richer mayonnaise dressing. In any case the salad is never mixed until time to serve it, and then the dressing should be lightly tossed in when all of the ingredients must be crisp and cold.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
PIMENTO SALAD.&#8212;Select sweet, red or green peppers, steam them till the skin cracks, then skin and seed. Place on the ice and shred with cold boiled fish, or shell fish or with a mixture of cold, cooked and diced potatoes, green peas or beans and sliced cucumbers or celery. The canned sweet red peppers or pimentos may be substituted. Spiced or pickled green peppers are also nice with a crisp green salad.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.

<p class="head">
"Dyspepsia is largely the result of trying to force square meals into round stomachs."
</p>
<p>
TIME FOR BOILING VEGETABLES.&#8212;Turnips should be peeled and boiled from forty minutes to one hour. Beets; boil from one to two hours then put in cold water then slip the skin off. Spinach; boil twenty minutes in uncovered kettle if green color is to be retained. Parsnips; boil from twenty to thirty minutes. String beans should be boiled one and one half hours, covered. Shelled beans require one hour to cook. Onions should be boiled from forty minutes to one hour, covered. Green corn; boil ten to twenty minutes. Green peas should be boiled in very little water, boil twenty minutes. Asparagus should be cooked the same as peas. Serve on toast with cream gravy or melted butter. Cabbage should be boiled from one to two hours in plenty of salted water. Carrots should be boiled from forty minutes to one hour. Whole potatoes should be put in boiling salted water and boil rapidly in covered kettle from fifteen to thirty minutes according to size and age. Test with the tines of a fork. Drain as soon as tender, remove the cover and set on back of range to dry. If they are to be mashed do not let them stand long.
</p>
<p>
VEGETABLES.&#8212;Vegetables of all kinds should be thoroughly picked over and well washed, and it is good sometimes to lay them into cold water a short time before cooking. Salt should not be added until partly cooked, as it has a tendency to harden them; they should cook steadily, do not allow them to stop boiling or simmering until they are thoroughly done. Drain, take some butter, heat it, add a little flour, mix smooth in the butter, add milk enough to make a smooth gravy, turn over vegetables, and let it heat through, then serve. This sauce is nice for many kinds. For asparagus, carrots, peas and a few others I keep some of the liquid they were boiled in, as it gives them a better flavor than milk alone.
</p>
<p>
GERMAN CABBAGE.&#8212;Another way of preparing cabbage in a German way: Cut up a cabbage and pick over carefully, wash well, heat some lard, drop cabbage into the hot grease, stir, so as to get it all heated, then let fry for a short time, but watch carefully to avoid burning, then add a quartered cooking apple; now when it gets too dry add hot water from the tea kettle, and let it simmer for three or four hours, the longer the better, add salt when almost tender, and about half hour before serving add quarter cup of sugar, quarter cup of vinegar, and let simmer the last half hour. This is the real German way.
</p>
<p>
GREEN STRING BEANS.&#8212;Select tender green string beans, cut the ends and remove strings, dice and wash thoroughly, put on in cold water to cover, add salt when partly cooked, then diced potatoes, and boil with beans about half an hour. Then heat either bacon drippings or common lard, add flour and brown, when ready turn the beans, potatoes, liquor and all into the hot mixture, add a little vinegar and pepper. Summer savory sprigs added to above give it a fine flavor.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger, German Cookery demonstration of vegetables.
</p>
<p>
CREAMED POTATOES.&#8212;Cut cold boiled potatoes into one half inch cubes, put these in a sauce pan. Add white sauce and finely cut parsley. Serve.

<p>
STUFFED POTATOES.&#8212;Bake the desired number of potatoes, cut open the top, scoop out inside, mash.

Serve hot.&#8212;Mrs. R. J. Walker.
</p>
<p>
STUFFED CABBAGE.&#8212;One large cabbage, two pounds beef chopped fine, one half cup melted butter, one half cup sweet cream or milk, one half teaspoon ginger, one half teaspoon allspice, salt and pepper to suit taste, whites of two eggs beaten stiff. Cut the stem end off the cabbage far enough down to form a cover, scoop out enough of the center of the cabbage to allow room for the meat. Mix the meat and other ingredients together and place in the cabbage, put on the cover, tie in a cloth and boil for three hours, or until the cabbage is done, in salt water.
</p>
<p>
SAUCE.&#8212;Two thirds cup butter, one half teaspoon each of ginger and allspice; salt and pepper to suit taste, and one quart milk, thicken with flour.&#8212;Mrs. Aaron J. Bessie.
</p>
<p>
NORWEGIAN SAUERKRAUT.&#8212;One medium sized head of cabbage cut in fine long strips with a knife, put in kettle, to this add three quarters of an ounce of flour sprinkled over the top of cabbage, one teaspoon salt, one teaspoon caraway seed, one pint beef broth. Let this boil slowly until tender, stir every few minutes to keep the cabbage from burning. When done add one teaspoon sugar and one teaspoon vinegar.&#8212;Mrs. R. Meidell.
</p>

<p>
SCALLOPED SWEET POTATOES.&#8212;Boil six sweet potatoes in salted water and cut them into thin slices in a baking dish. Mix with a well seasoned cream sauce, cover with fine bread crumbs and dot with butter. Brown in the oven.
</p>
<p>
POTATO SOUFFLE.&#8212;Four good sized potatoes boiled and mashed fine, one half teacup of milk, one tablespoon butter.

Do not beat often adding the white of egg. Bake twenty minutes in a brisk oven. Serve while hot with meats that have gravy.&#8212;Mrs. Mary Harvey.
</p>
<p>
COLD SLAW.&#8212;This is a creole dish and very delicious. Cut very fine a quarter of a head of firm white cabbage. Put it into a covered dish, pour over it one half cupful of vinegar, one half tablespoonful of salt and toss it about lightly with a fork. Into a skillet pour one half cupful of milk, a teaspoonful of butter and one quarter of a cupful of sugar. Beat one egg light. Let the milk come to a boil, mix a teaspoonful of the milk with the egg, add sugar and butter, allow it to cook until a custard is formed, then pour over the sliced cabbage. Allow it to become very cold before using. As vinegars differ do not use so much if very strong.&#8212;Mrs. A. McKay.
</p>
<p>
CANNED STRING BEANS.&#8212;Prepare the beans as for dinner&#8212;that is, string and break into one inch pieces. Have your cans and top all cleansed; then fill the cans with the beans&#8212;after washing them, of course&#8212;and shake them down. Put one teaspoonful of salt to a quart of beans after the cans are full. Now put fresh cold water upon them to overflowing. I run a thin knife between the can and the beans to get all the air bubbles out. Put on the rubbers and then the lids, but not tight&#8212;only as you can with the thumb and one finger. Lay thin boards in the bottom of the boiler and set your can on them; fill to the lids with cold water. I let them boil two hours after they are fairly at it; then I take them out one by one, and screw down the tops and set to get cold before putting away. When we eat them I drain off all the water, put in a piece of butter and pepper and milk, or any way I want them. I never lost a can.&#8212;Contributed.

<p>
GERMAN SAUER KRAUT.&#8212;For this use nice, white, firm cabbages, slice them in very fine shreds, on one of these kraut cutters; place a layer of salt into a jar or keg, and alternately cabbage and salt, being careful to have salt on top. As each layer of cabbage is added it must be pounded down with a heavy pestle, and layers added as soon as the juice floods on the surface. When the jar is full, it must be set in a dry place, covered with a cloth, a wooden cover and then weight it down heavy, after it ferments the pickle must be drawn off and replaced by fresh until the liquor is clear. Renew the cloth and wash weight and cover and let stand for a month, then it is ready for use. Great care must be taken to have the cover perfectly clean. Each time the jar is opened it must be properly closed and be sure to always have some liquor on top. Either clear or salt water may be added. Now to boil the kraut. Put on in cold water, let it come to a boil, and never boil very fast but let it simmer for four or more hours. Parboil a nice fat piece of fresh pork and place in same kettle with kraut; let it boil together for some hours; about one hour before taking it up grate half a small raw potato into the kraut, let it simmer away. This gives it a nice flavor and also tends to give it a smoother appearance. The oftener you warm over sauer kraut the better it gets. They say it should be cooked nine times. I never tried it for ours never lasted that long.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger, demonstrated at Domestic Science club.
</p>
<p>
GERMAN DILL PICKLES.&#8212;Select medium sized cucumbers, as near of a size as possible, soak over night in a weak brine, or plain well water.

Some wrap each cucumber in grape leaves, and claim it keeps them more solid and makes them much nicer. After they are all carefully packed then make a brine which will bear an egg, then add as much water as you have brine, to each gallon add one quart of strong vinegar, weight them down, but not too heavy. Remove all the scum which arises.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger.

GENERAL DIRECTIONS FOR MAKING CAKE.&#8212;Cream the butter and sugar, usually beat the whites and yolks of eggs separately, mix the yolks with the butter and sugar, add the milk, sift the baking powder with the flour and stir in a little at a time then the whites of the eggs, then the flavoring. For cakes containing no butter beat the egg yolks until very light and thick. Add the sugar gradually beating until very light and spongy. Add flavoring and liquid. Have the whites beaten to a stiff froth adding them alternately with the sifted flour (mixed with the baking powder or cream of tartar) and cut both in very lightly.
</p>
<p>
GOLD CAKE.&#8212;Yolks of eight eggs, one and one fourth cups granulated sugar, three fourths cup butter, three fourths cup water, two and one half cups flour, two heaping teaspoons baking powder, one half teaspoon of lemon extract. Sift flour and measure, add baking powder and sift three times. Cream butter and sugar until light and creamy, add yolks beaten light and beat well together, then add water and flavoring and the flour. Beat hard. Bake in greased tin or in layers. Loaf cakes are nicer baked in a funnel cake pan.&#8212;Mrs. Fred Southard.

Dissolve one even teaspoon of soda in one tablespoon of the milk and add it with the milk. Cut in the beaten whites of eggs last, as you do for sponge cake. Flavor with lemon, vanilla or almond extract as preferred. Bake in a greased funnel tin. Bake twenty minutes in a moderately warm oven, then increase the heat and bake to fifty minutes or until done. Ice with boiled frosting.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.

<p>
SILVER OR GOLD CAKE.&#8212;Three fourths cup butter, one and one half cups sugar, one half cup cold water, with one half teaspoon of soda dissolved in it, two and one half large cups of flour sifted with one level teaspoon of cream of tartar (or use two level teaspoons of baking powder and omit the soda and cream of tartar) and lastly the flavoring and stiffly beaten whites of eight eggs. Cream butter and sugar until light and smooth, add water but do not stir, then beat in the flour and beat five minutes. Cut in the whites and bake in a greased funnel loaf cake tin in a moderate oven forty minutes or until done when tested with a broom straw.

Wash one half cup of butter, then beat to a cream and add slowly enough thick syrup to sweeten.

Bake in slow oven, and do not grease your pan. With a gas stove one young friend puts the grate in the oven in its lowest sliding place and bakes her angel cake there, lighting both burners for one minute. Then she turns the front out and the other so low that it looks like a row of blue beads. She bakes it one hour. Another, equally successful, puts her grate a little higher than the middle of the oven, and bakes the cake there for one half hour with a very moderate oven.
</p>

Cream three fourths cup of butter with two cups of sugar until light. It is best to cream the butter first and add sugar gradually especially if the butter is hard and cold. Beat in yolks of two eggs, one half cup of sour milk or butter milk, one teaspoon of soda dissolved in a little water, (about two tablespoonfuls,) two cups of flour sifted, and beaten whites of two eggs. Beat well, then add the chocolate. Bake in one sheet in a dripping pan lined with greased paper. Let the cake stand in the pan. Ice with boiled frosting and when firm and cold, cover with one square of chocolate that has been melted in one teaspoon of butter in a cup placed in a pan of hot water for five minutes. Pour the chocolate over the white frosting and spread evenly with a silver knife. Cut the cake diagonally across the pan into two inch diamond shaped pieces. A cupful of floured chopped nuts may be added to the cake batter before baking, if nut loaf is liked, and sometimes I place a half English walnut in the center of the frosting on each diamond. This chocolate and white frosting is also nice with white layer cake and chopped nuts make it extra nice for a thick filling to a square two layer cake, shaking the nuts over the white frosting and then baking them with the chocolate.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
SPONGE CAKE.&#8212;Beat four eggs and one cupful of granulated sugar until mixture is creamy white.

SNOW SPONGE CAKE WITH COCOANUT FILLING.&#8212;Beat the whites of ten eggs very light, add one and one half cupfuls of powdered sugar and beat until the bowl can be inverted and retain the eggs. Add one teaspoon cream tartar to one cupful of flour and sift several times. Cut this into the egg mixture, flavor with almond extract and turn into square ungreased cake tins, baking in two sheets. Fill with cocoanut frosting made by boiling two cupfuls of sugar with water until it hairs from the spoon, turn it hot on to the beaten whites of two eggs and whip to a frosting. Add one small cocoanut which has been freed from the shell and all brown skin and grated fine. Flavor with lemon or vanilla. If fresh cocoanut cannot be obtained try soaking the shredded cocoanut in warm milk and steaming it an hour or two before using and then squeeze it dry. This will make it more moist. If you have only one angel cake tin, split the cake through the center after it is cold and put the icing between the layers. Swans down flour is best for this cake and the fresh cocoanut make a delicious filling.&#8212;Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
SUNSHINE CAKE.&#8212;Whites of ten eggs, yolks of six, one level teaspoonful of cream of tartar, one and one half cupfuls of sugar, sifted, one cupful of flour, sifted twice, the grated peel of one orange or one teaspoonful of lemon or vanilla or one half teaspoon of almond extract. Beat whites very stiff, then beat in one half of the sugar, beat yolks light about ten minutes, add the flavoring and balance of the sugar and beat five minutes. Mix yolks and whites lightly together and cut in the flour that has been sifted with the cream of tartar. Bake in an ungreased, funnel angel cake tin about an hour in a slow oven or 45 minutes in a moderate oven. Avoid baking too long as it makes the cake dry and coarse. When the cake shrinks from the tin at sides of the pan it is sufficiently baked. Invert the tin and let it stand until cold. If it sticks then run a knife around the edge of cake, pat the tin slightly on the bottom and sides until it drops from the pan. If a frosted cake is preferred ice it with white boiled icing.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.

Spread immediately on the cake. Chopped nuts are nice added to this or halved English walnuts may be placed regularly on top of a square cake. Chocolate may be added to the warm fondant before beating it. White icing like this is nice covered with thin layer of chocolate melted with butter or English walnuts buried in the white icing and then covered with chocolate fondant makes a delicious filling for layer cake. This caramel filling with nuts is especially nice on Devil's Food or dark chocolate. Brown sugar caramel is made likewise using half granulated and half brown sugar for the fondant.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
MARSHMALLOW FILLING OR ICING FOR ANGEL FOOD CAKE.&#8212;Steam one pound of marsh mallows with one pint of milk, and beat into this half a pint of whipped cream and one half cup chopped nuts.

The first will be Springelie. One pound of sugar, one pound of flour, four eggs, butter the size of a walnut and one half teaspoon of baking powder.

Pastry, Pies and Tarts
</p>
<p class="head">
"Cook your husband what he likes, and save a hundred household strikes."
</p>
<p>
PIE CRUST.&#8212;For one pie, mix one large cup of flour sifted with half a teaspoon of salt, with one half cup of lard and butter mixed. Blend these ingredients thoroughly with the hands or cut and shape with a knife, then lightly mix in one quarter cup ice cold water, just enough to bind the flour and lard together. Use scant measure of water and do not handle much. Flour the molding board and quickly roll half the dough into a thin crust and line the pie tin. Fill the pie with prepared fruit, wet the edges of the crust with water, roll out the balance of the dough for the upper crust, gash it across the center and lift it carefully and cover the pie, pressing edges together with a fork. If a glazed crust is wanted rub the crust over with a little milk, egg and sugar slightly mixed together. This insures a nice brown crust. The oven should be hot enough to turn white note paper a nice, rich brown color in five minutes time. Pastry requires a brisk oven but not too hot. The ingredients for pastry should be very cold. The measure of shortening (lard) should be generous and the water scant and it should not be handled after the water is added only sufficient to lift out of the mixing bowl and roll out. Flour the board well and flour the rolling pin.
</p>
<p>
CURRANT PIE.&#8212;One cup currants (fresh fruit), one cup sugar, one tablespoon flour, two tablespoons water, one lump of butter and yolks of two eggs. Beat all together and bake in one crust. When done frost with the beaten whites of the eggs.&#8212;Mrs. Davidson.
</p>
<p>
CHERRY PIE.&#8212;Line a pie plate with pie crust, fill it generously half full of fresh, stoned sour cherries, and sprinkle a generous cupful of sugar over them mixed with one large tablespoon of flour, dot with one level tablespoon of butter cut into bits, cover with another layer of cherries sprinkled lightly with sugar. Cover with an upper crust wetting the edges and pressing well together to prevent juice escaping. Cut a gash in center of top crust to allow steam to escape and bake in a moderate oven for forty minutes or until cherries are tender and the juice bubbles in a simp. If a novice at the work, test the fruit with a broom straw through the gash in the upper crust. If the straw can pierce the fruit easily the pie is done.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
FRESH FRUIT PIES.&#8212;The recipe for cherry pie applies to all fresh berry or fruit pies gauging the sugar and flour according to the juicy sweetness of the fruit. Gooseberries, currants, strawberries, cranberries and plums will take good full measures of sugar and flour. Raspberries, blue berries and black berries require less sugar and apricots and peaches and apples small measures of flour. A little butter improves the flavor of all fruit pies and apple pie needs a dusting of nutmeg or cinnamon before adding the top crust. Canned fruit may be drained free of its syrup and used the same way using less sugar and adding half a cupful of the syrup.&#8212;L. W. W.
</p>
<p>
LEMON PIE. Crust.&#8212;One half large cup of flour, one heaping tablespoon of lard, pinch of salt. Mix well. Add enough water to make paste. Roll thin, put in tin, prick with fork and bake. Filling. One large cup of sugar, two heaping tablespoons of flour, one large cup of boiling water, butter the size of a walnut, juice and grated rind of one lemon, yolks of two eggs. Mix the flour and sugar together, add boiling water, put on the stove and let come to a boil, then add butter, yolks of two eggs, juice and grated rind of one lemon. Remove from fire at once. Beat the whites of two eggs with two tablespoons of sugar and put on top. Put in oven to brown.&#8212;Mrs. R. Meidell.
</p>
<p>
AMERICAN PRUNE PIE.&#8212;Stew about twenty four or thirty prunes, pitt and sweeten the prunes. Bake a pie crust. Whip one half pint of cream, sweeten with sugar, flavor with vanilla. Put a layer of prunes in the crust, then the whipped cream on top and serve cold.&#8212;Mrs. R. Meidell.
</p>
<p>
PUMPKIN PIE.&#8212;One cupful of mashed pumpkin, three quarters cup of sugar, one teaspoonful of salt, one half teaspoonful each of mace, cinnamon and ginger. Heat one teacupful of milk and beat three eggs and add to mixture. Bake with under crust only.&#8212;Mrs. H. Hanson.
</p>
<p>
PUMPKIN PIE.&#8212;One quart milk, three cups stewed pumpkin, one tablespoon flour, four eggs, one and one half cups brown sugar, one half cup molasses, one teaspoon salt, one level tablespoon cinnamon, one teaspoon ginger, one tablespoon melted butter. Bake with an under crust. Makes three pies. Beat eggs, add pumpkin, then flour, sugar, salt, spices, molasses and butter and lastly the milk which may be partly cream. Mix well, fill pie tins which have been lined with pie crust and bake from thirty to forty minutes.&#8212;L. W. W.
</p>
<p>
RHUBARB PIE.&#8212;One cup diced fresh rhubarb, one cup sugar, one tablespoon flour. Mix all together, turn into a pie tin lined with pie crust. Dot bits of butter over the top of rhubarb, sprinkle with one tablespoon of water. Cover with top crust and bake in moderate oven about forty minutes.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CREAM PIE.&#8212;Two yolks of eggs beaten with one half cup sugar, add one large tablespoon of flour and a scant tablespoon of corn starch dissolved in a little milk. Cook in one pint of boiling milk on back of range, stirring constantly. Flavor with vanilla or lemon. Fill baked pastry shell, cover with meringue and brown in oven. Serve cold.&#8212;L. W. W.
</p>
<p>
CUSTARD PIES.&#8212;The rule for custard pie is four beaten eggs and one scant cup sugar to each quart of milk. For one small pie use half this recipe. Mix all together and add flavoring of vanilla, lemon, almond or nutmeg. Line deep pie tin with pie crust and fill with the raw custard and bake in a moderate oven until the custard sets and can be cut clean with a silver knife. Do not bake too long or it will be dry and tough and use scant sugar measure to avoid a watery custard. Cocoanut custard pie is made by adding one cup of shredded cocoanut before baking. Date pie is made by pressing stewed dates through a colander and adding to the custard. Open fruit custard pies are made by laying a layer of prepared fruit on the crust in the tin and covering with the raw custard. All custard pies are baked with an under crust only. Pumpkin, squash and sweet potato pies are made by adding a quart of the cooked and mashed vegetable to each quart of custard and adding spices and salt to suit individual taste.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CREAM PIES.&#8212;The cream fillings are cooked on top of stove until thick. Line pie tins with a rich pie crust, pick with a fork to let out air while baking, and bake a golden brown, then fill with the cooked filling, cover with a meringue and bake until meringue sets. The rule for the cream filling is two eggs beaten with half a cup of sugar and one large tablespoon of flour or one scant tablespoon of cornstarch mixed smooth with a little milk, add flavoring. Bring two small cups of milk or water to a boil, add the egg mixture and cook thick. If liked add one teaspoon of butter to the milk or water. For chocolate pie double the sugar and use two squares of chocolate shaved fine and heat with the cream filling. For pineapple add grated pineapple to the cream filling, double the measure of flour as acids thin the mixture considerably. For lemon cream pie use the juice and grated rind of one large lemon or two small ones and double the flour and sugar measure. (For orange pie use juice of one large orange and half a lemon.) In lemon and orange pie water is generally used in preference to milk and if a rich pie is liked use an extra egg yolk and a large measure of sugar.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
MERINGUE.&#8212;To make the meringue, beat the whites of two eggs very light and stiff, cut in two level tablespoons of sugar and beat five minutes. Spread on top of the filled pie, sprinkle lightly with sugar and brown in a slow oven. When meringue is firm to the touch it is done and will not fall or shrink, if under-done it falls. If the oven is too hot leave the oven door open for three minutes before putting the meringue in to bake. Long beating of the whites of eggs and sugar however will usually make a good, thick and firm meringue.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
ENGLISH ORANGE CHEESE CAKES OR TARTS.&#8212;One half pound sugar (one cup) mixed with one fourth pound butter (one half cup) add three eggs, (reserving white of one); juice of two oranges and grated rind of one; juice of one lemon. Beat well. Simmer until like honey. Fill baked patty or tart shells of pie crust. Make a meringue of the stiffly beaten white of egg and one tablespoon of sugar. Frost the tarts, sprinkle with sugar and brown in a moderate oven. Serve cold.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
DEVIL'S FOOD CAKE.&#8212;One and one half cups of sugar, creamed with one half cup butter, yolks of three eggs, one half cup milk, one square chocolate melted in half cup boiling water, two cups flour sifted with two heaping teaspoons baking powder. Add vanilla and the unbeaten whites of the three eggs the last thing.&#8212;Mrs. T. B. Huff.
</p>
<p>
BURNT SUGAR CAKE.&#8212;One and one half cups sugar creamed with one half cup butter, yolks of three eggs, one large cup cold water, three large tablespoons of thick burnt sugar or enough to make a light brown in color; two cups flour sifted with two heaping teaspoons baking powder. Add the unbeaten whites of the three eggs and vanilla the last thing. Frost with boiled frosting to which has been added one tablespoon of burnt sugar and a half cup broken nut meats.&#8212;Mrs. T. B. Huff.
</p>
<p>
TO MAKE BURNT SUGAR.&#8212;Put in a sauce pan one cup sugar and cook, stirring constantly; the sugar will then form into lumps, then melt and throw off a thick black smoke. Now take from fire and add three tablespoons hot water and place on stove and let come to a good boil; it is then ready to use and can be kept indefinitely.&#8212;Mrs. T. B. Huff.
</p>
<p>
CHOCOLATE FROSTING.&#8212;To make a good chocolate frosting make a quantity of fudge, beating it until very smooth and until it sets. Then add a teaspoon, or the necessary amount of cream, or milk, until the right consistency to spread.&#8212;Mrs. T. B. Huff.
</p>
<p>
BAKED FISH.&#8212;Large white fish, pike or cat fish are best, but small fish can also be used. Put in a pan, sprinkle well with salt and pepper and cover with bits of butter; then pour a little water or milk in the pan and bake, basting the fish often, and adding more water or milk as needed. This takes about a half hour to bake in a hot oven. Make a white gravy of milk, butter and flour, season well and add a can of mushroom and serve over the fish. Delicious.&#8212;Mrs. T. B. Huff.
</p>
<p>
COCOANUT CHEESE CAKES OR TARTS.&#8212;Boil one pint of sugar with two thirds of a pint of water and add one and one half cups of shredded cocoanut and boil slowly twelve minutes; remove to rear of range and while warm beat in one half cup of butter until smooth; then beat in the beaten yolks of five or six eggs. Flavor with lemon juice or vanilla or almond extract. Line patty pans or gem tins with a rich pastry crust, fill with the cocoanut custard and bake. They are pretty capped with a cube of currant jelly. Serve either hot or cold.
</p>
<p>
APPLE CHEESE CAKES.&#8212;One pint of steamed, sweetened and stewed apple sauce heated. Add grated rind of half a lemon, two level tablespoons of butter and beat smooth, then cut in two eggs beaten well. Bake in patty pans lined with pastry. Good way to use left over pie crust and apple sauce.
</p>
<p>
MINCE MEAT.&#8212;Four pounds of lean boiled meat, chopped fine; twice its weight in sour apples, peeled, cored and chopped fine, one pound of minced suet; three pounds of seeded raisins, two pounds of currants; one pound of brown sugar; one pint of molasses and of maple syrup or of fruit syrup, two quarts of sweet fresh cider, one pint of cider boiled, one tablespoon of salt, one scant teaspoon of pepper, one tablespoon each of mace, allspice and cloves, four tablespoons of cinnamon. Mix well and bring to a boil on the stove. When nearly cold stir in one pint of brandy and one pint of wine. If these are not liked use syrup from pickles or pears or unfermented grape juice. Pack in a large stone crock or seal in Mason jars and keep covered in a cool place. Will keep good all winter. Half of this recipe will suffice for the winter for a small family. Considering that the mince meats put up in cartons and packages contain no meat and often an inferior grade of dried apples, it certainly pays to make mince meat at home out of fresh material, when butchering is done and apples are cheapest.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
MINCE MEAT. (Small jar for small family.) Two cups chopped boiled meat, or of hamburger steak, steamed tender in a double boiler, four cups of chopped apples, one pint of sweet cider or of juice from pickled peaches, one cup molasses, two cups sugar (scant), juice of three lemons, one cup shredded or chopped suet or one half cupful of butter or sweet drippings, one teaspoon of salt, mixed spices to suit taste. Cook five minutes. When ready for pie thin the mixture with cider or with a glass of tart jelly melted and add seeded raisins or currants and a little brandy if liked. Bake between two crusts of pastry and serve warm. One heaping cup of mince meat will make one pie. Fruit juice left from canned fruit is nice added to mince meat and often can be nicely utilized this way.
</p>
<p>
NEOPOLITANS.&#8212;Take pie crust left over after mixing pie. Roll it into a thin sheet and cut into oblong strips three by two inches. Bake in quick oven. Spread half with jam, lay balance of strips over that like sandwiches and spread jam or jelly on top. Dust with powdered sugar. Lemon or orange cake filling or frosting may be used instead of juice or marmolade, and crushed fresh, sweetened berries make a good filling and covering if capped with whipped cream.
</p>
<p>
ENGLISH CHEESE PIE.&#8212;One cupful of thick sour cream or milk curd, salted slightly, two beaten eggs, three fourths cup of sweet milk, one half cup sugar, one half cupful of English currants (dried). Rub curd thoroughly first and mix with other ingredients. Bake in a deep pie tin lined with pie crust. Powder with cinnamon.
</p>
<p>
FRENCH TART.&#8212;Pound eight macaroons fine, pour boiling milk over them to make a soft batter, add six well beaten eggs and one half cupful of sugar. Cook thick, add one half cup of butter and the juice of an orange. Line a pie with pastry, fill with the mixture and bake. Dust with powdered sugar before serving. Eight good sized macaroons will take from two to three cups of milk.
</p>
<p>
PATTIES.&#8212;Three cups flour, one cup lard, three fourths cup of ice water, one teaspoon baking powder, one teaspoon salt. Mix and roll like pie crust. Bake in patty pans. Makes thirty patties.
</p>
<p>

When cool and beginning to show signs of stiffening beat in one half cupful of strawberries which have been mashed and sweetened with a tablespoonful of sugar, then fold in the stiffly beaten white of an egg and finally one half cupful of cream, whipped very stiff. Fill wet molds and leave on ice three hours. Serve with or without whipped cream.
</p>
<p>

Now whip one cupful of cream, sweetened with two level tablespoonfuls of sugar, lightly fold the strawberry gelatine in, a few drops at a time. Turn into a wet mold and put on ice for two hours. If carefully mixed there will be no settling at the bottom. The mold for this need not be lined with cake, but a delicate wafer of some sort, preferably vanilla, should be served with it if it is molded plain.
</p>
<p>
LEMON JELLY.&#8212;Soak one box Knox sparkling gelatine in one pint cold water, two minutes; add two pints boiling water, one and one half cups sugar, and stir until dissolved; add juice of three lemons, strain through jelly bag into molds.

</p>
<p>
PINEAPPLE JELLY.&#8212;Read this recipe carefully and follow instructions. Soak one box Knox gelatine in one pint cold water, set on stove in double boiler to dissolve; when gelatine is cold and beginning to set, beat into it pineapple juice and pineapple, and place on ice to harden. Be sure you follow the above, for if you mix pineapple and its syrup with gelatine when you first make it, the acid in it will digest the gelatine so it will not harden.
</p>
<p>

Mix the dry ingredients with beaten eggs and sugar; next put in the brandy and, lastly, the whites of four eggs beaten stiff, are folded into the mixture. (Reserve the other four for the meringue. Pour into a "spring form" and bake in a moderate oven. When the "torte" is done, spread jelly on the top and the meringue made with the reserved eggs upon the jelly. Put back into the oven until the meringue is lightly colored.
</p>
<p>
GERMAN PAN CAKES FOR DESSERT OR LUNCH.&#8212;Beat yolks of six eggs and then beat whites of three to a stiff froth. Mix with three fourths cup grated bread crumbs, one cup cream and a large cupful of flour, pour in a buttered sauce pan, sprinkle with sugar and stir over the fire until thick then fry in butter, on a hot skillett, like pan cakes. Put on a hot dish, sift powdered sugar on them and sprinkle with lemon juice and serve hot.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
FRUIT TRIFLE.&#8212;Beat whites of six eggs light, add six tablespoons of sugar and beat about half an hour then beat in one cupful of grated pineapple or cut up fresh strawberries or fresh raspberries or cut up fresh, ripe peaches or apricots or any fruit jam or jelly and beat five minutes.

"Trifle" is sometimes made by using whipped cream, sweetened, and adding one cupful of cut up fresh berries, or peaches or orange pulp or bananas chopped, or half a glass of any fruit, jam or any jelly cut into small pieces. Beat it through the whipped cream. This is a simple and palatable dessert which can be quickly made.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
JUNKET.&#8212;One quart of warm milk, two tablespoons brandy; wine or vanilla; two tablespoons sugar, one junket tablet or one tablespoon of rennet.

"Which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach this hot weather."&#8212;Shakespeare.
</p>
<p>
ICE CREAM.&#8212;In packing the freezer use rock salt and crush the ice very fine. Put it in a heavy grain sack and pound and mash until nearly as fine as snow. Measure ice and salt allowing four parts ice to one of salt or ten pounds of ice to three of salt. Pack ice in layers three inches deep, then shake over one large saucerful of salt, then another three inch layer of ice and more salt, alternating ice and salt until you reach top of can. Pack the can with cream, put on the top of freezer, and let cream stand until it freezes on edges, then turn the dasher slowly for ten minutes, then quickly until cream is frozen thick but not too hard. Remove the dasher, put on the top and cork, repack freezer with ice, cover with heavy carpet and let cream ripen two or three hours.&#8212;Mrs. C. H. McKay.
</p>
<p>
ICE CREAM.&#8212;Without cooking. Two quarts of thick cream, two cups sugar. Mix and stand until sugar dissolves. Flavor to suit taste and freeze.&#8212;Mrs. C. H. McKay.
</p>
<p>
CARAMEL ICE CREAM.&#8212;Beat three eggs, one cup sugar and one half cup of flour together and cook with one pint rich milk. Brown one cupful of granulated sugar to a caramel and add to this hot custard. Cool and add one quart thick cream. Freeze.&#8212;Mrs. C. H. McKay.
</p>
<p>
CHOCOLATE ICE CREAM.&#8212;Let one large pint of milk come to a boil, add one cup of sugar and one third cup of flour mixed with the beaten yolks of three eggs; three fourths cake of sweet chocolate. Cook until thick and creamy, stirring constantly. Cool and add one quart of cream, one cup sugar and pinch of salt. Add vanilla flavoring and freeze. When partly frozen add the beaten whites of the eggs and freeze until firm but not too hard. Pack freezer well, cover and let it ripen two or three hours if possible.&#8212;Mrs. C. H. McKay.
</p>
<p>
MARYLAND ICE.&#8212;Two quarts ripe strawberries mashed with four cups sugar. Stand one hour and squeeze out the juice through a sieve or cheese cloth. Add two quarts of water and freeze. Remove water from freezer when ice is half frozen, pack, and let it stand twenty minutes. Then scoop out the center; leave wall intact. Make a filling of one pint of cream, one half cup sugar, one teaspoon flavoring beaten and whipped until stiff. Add one half cup of chopped or rolled nuts. Fill the cavity in the strawberry ice with this mixture. Repack the freezer and let it ripen four or more hours. When ready to serve, remove freezer can, wrap it in a cloth dipped in boiling water, let stand one minute when the mould of ice cream will slip out easily onto the serving platter. Serve in thick slices.&#8212;Mrs. C. H. McKay.
</p>
<p>
MOUSSE.&#8212;(Without cream.) Rub one quart of berries through a sieve, add one cupful of powdered sugar, one ounce of dissolved gelatine, and the whites of five eggs beaten stiff. Put in a mold and pack in ice and salt for three or four hours.&#8212;Mrs. C. H. McKay.

</p>
<p>
VANILLA ICE CREAM.&#8212;One quart thick cream, seven tablespoons of sugar, one half of a vanilla bean. Cut bean into halves, scrape out seeds and mix with sugar. Add sugar to half of the cream, and put in the balance of the bean. Heat and dissolve sugar in hot cream. Remove from fire, strain and cool. Add remaining cream and freeze. The flavor of the bean makes delicious ice cream but of course good vanilla extract may be substituted. Use a tablespoon of extract. Plain ice cream is nice served with hot chocolate caramel sauce or with maple sauce and chopped nuts.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
CHOCOLATE CARAMEL SAUCE.&#8212;One and one half cups brown sugar, one half cup of milk, four ounces of chocolate. Stir all together on back of range until chocolate is melted and smooth; then boil until it forms a soft ball when tried in cold water. Serve hot over the ice cream. Makes a nice pudding sauce also and is nice on cream puffs or eclairs.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
RED RASPBERRY ICE CREAM.&#8212;Follow directions for chocolate ice cream given above, omitting the chocolate and adding one quart of ripe red raspberries pressed through a sieve and sweetened, when the cream is half frozen, and when the meringue is added also. Proceed with the freezing and ripen two or more hours before serving. Strawberries, apricots and peaches are equally as good used this way.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
TORTONI ICE CREAM.&#8212;Boil one and one half cups sugar with water to cover until it threads from the spoon. Pour it over the stiffly beaten whites of three eggs and beat well.

</p>
<p>
MAPLE MOUSSE.&#8212;Boil a cupful of maple syrup three minutes and stir into the beaten yolks of three eggs. Put back in dish syrup was boiled in and boil two minutes. Cool.

Fruit, Ices or Sherbets
</b>
</p>
<p>
LEMON SHERBET.&#8212;One pound of sugar and one quart of water boiled to thin syrup and when cool add the grated rind of two lemons and the juice of six. For a water ice stir it now and then in the freezer and freeze slowly until like wet snow. For a sherbet freeze quickly until light and stiff. For a sorbet, add a meringue made of the beaten white of egg and sugar to the partially frozen ice.
</p>
<p>
ORANGE SHERBET.&#8212;Add the juice of six oranges and grated rind of three and the juice of one lemon to the above sugar and water syrup and freeze.
</p>
<p>
PINEAPPLE SHERBET.&#8212;Add one pint of grated pineapple and juice of one lemon to above syrup and freeze rapidly.
</p>
<p>
MINT SHERBET.&#8212;Pound the leaves of two dozen stalks of mint to a pulp, add to the syrup as above with the juice of two lemons and freeze or use mint extract.
</p>
<p>
GRAPE SHERBET.&#8212;Add the juice of one lemon and a pint of grape juice to the above syrup and freeze.
</p>
<p>
BERRY SHERBET.&#8212;Add one pint of the berry juice and juice of two lemons to above syrup and freeze.
</p>
<p>
CRANBERRY SHERBET.&#8212;One pint of strained and sweetened cooked cranberry juice and the juice of two lemons added to above syrup and freeze stiff. Fruit jellies may be melted and strained and used as substitutes for the fresh fruit juice.
</p>
<p>
FROZEN STRAWBERRIES.&#8212;Mash one quart of berries, add one and one half cups sugar and the juice of one lemon. Let it stand one hour, then add one pint of water and freeze like ice cream. Serve in punch glasses with whipped cream. Peaches and apricots are also nice frozen likewise as are cooked cranberries pressed through a colander.
</p>
<p>
FRAPPE.&#8212;This is strictly speaking of drink partially frozen until like wet snow. Grape Frappe is frozen coffee and lemon Frappe is partly frozen lemonade. A punch is merely a cold fruit drink with a block of ice floating in it. It is usually made of a combination of fruit juices sweetened and wines and liquors are frequently added to it.
</p>
<p>
PARFAIT AND MOUSSE.&#8212;This is frozen whipped cream, sweetened and flavored to suit the taste. It is packed in a mould and buried in crushed ice and salt for several hours. The cream should be frozen one and one half inches deep. The center remains soft. The opening of the mould should be bound with a strip of muslin dipped in melted suet or butter. Quick parfait is made by adding whipped cream to ice cream. At serving time beat in the whipped cream. Coffee ice cream with whipped cream is much liked, as are chocolate and caramel ice cream served this way. Macaroon mousse is made by adding crushed and rolled macaroons to whipped cream and burying the mould in ice and salt. Chopped nuts are used the same way and crushed fruit.
</p>
<p>
LEMON ICE.&#8212;Two and three fourths cups sugar, two tablespoons corn starch; add one quart boiling water. When cool add juice of eight lemons and when half frozen add whites of three eggs and one pint thick cream.&#8212;Mrs. D. E. Plier.
</p>
<p>
CURRANT ICE.&#8212;One pint currant juice (or two glasses of currant jelly), two lemons and one orange, three cups sugar, two quarts water. Pour juices over sugar and stir until dissolved then add water and freeze. The whites of two eggs may be added just before the freezing is completed.&#8212;Mrs. Schollander.
</p>
<p>
PINEAPPLE SHERBET.&#8212;One quart of granulated sugar, and one quart cold water brought to a boil. Pour over one quart can of grated pineapple and juice of six lemons. Strain and put into freezer. When cold add whites of three eggs beaten stiff with one tablespoon of sugar. Freeze.&#8212;Mrs. W. S. Davidson.
</p>
<p>
PISTACHO MOUSSE.&#8212;Whip a pint of cream very stiff, beat into it lightly four tablespoonfuls of powdered sugar; flavor to taste with pistacho extract and stir in one half cupful of chopped nuts. Last of all color a delicate green with vegetable coloring mixture. Turn all cream into a mould and pack with ice and salt for four hours.&#8212;Mrs. J. D. Wolpert.
</p>
<p>
STRAWBERRY ICE CREAM.&#8212;Three cupfuls of cream and one of milk, or one quart of thin cream, three quarters of a cupful of sugar; scald, but do not boil. Beat until cold, add one cupful of strawberries mashed with their juice and one half cupful of sugar. Place in freezer, pack in ice and salt, using three quarters ice and one quarter salt, and freeze until as stiff as can be turned. Remove dasher, work up and down with a long handled spoon to pack solidly and set aside for twenty minutes or longer. Serve garnished with a half cupful of strawberries cut in two. For individual servings a simple way is to pack the ice cream in pound or half pound baking powder tins after it has been frozen and bury it in ice and salt. It then may be turned out and sliced in rounds, one round to a person, and the strawberries used to decorate each service. Of course, if this is done the cream must be very firm and should be packed at least two hours before it is used. To avoid much melting the bucket may be put in the ice box in a tin pan.
</p>
<p>
STRAWBERRY MOUSSE.&#8212;Dissolve one tablespoonful of granulated gelatine in one quarter cupful of water by placing the bowl containing it in a pan of hot water; when smooth add three quarters of a cupful of powdered sugar and stir until cool. Strain gradually into two cupfuls of cream whipped very stiff, add one cupful of fresh strawberries which have been chopped fine with a silver knife and sugared with one third cupful of sugar. Have the mould already packed in ice and salt, put the mousse into it by the spoonful, first being sure that all the ingredients are well mixed; cover with buttered paper, put on the lid of one mould and pile ice and salt on top. Put in a cold place for two to four hours. Unmold and serve with halved strawberries and sponge cake or angels food.
</p>
<p>
ORANGE WATER ICE.&#8212;Juice of six oranges, two teaspoons extract of orange, juice of one lemon, one quart water, one pound powdered sugar, one gill rich, sweet cream, add all together and strain. Freeze same as ice cream.&#8212;Mrs. H. J. Liddell.
</p>
<p>
LEMON SHERBET WITH CREAM.&#8212;Mix four large cups of sugar with three level tablespoons of flour and stir in two quarts of boiling water and cook thick. Cool and add the juice of one dozen lemons. Strain and freeze. When half frozen add one pint of cream whipped stiff with half a cupful of sugar and add the beaten whites of two eggs. Stir well through the half frozen sherbet and finish freezing. When firm, remove the dasher from the freezer, repack and cover freezer with a carpet or heavy blanket. Let it ripen two hours or more. Makes one gallon of sherbet.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
LEMON SHERBET.&#8212;Juice of three or four lemons, according to size, two cups sugar, one quart of fresh sweet milk. Mix lemon juice and sugar and put them in the freezer and let stand while you pack freezer, quickly stir in ice cold milk and freeze quickly. The milk must be fresh morning's milk and it must commence to freeze immediately or it will curdle. Grated pineapple may be added to this if liked. After it is frozen the beaten whites of two eggs mixed with two tablespoons of sugar, should be stirred through the sherbet and left to ripen until serving time. Cream may be used instead of milk but half of it should be scalded with half of the sugar and cooled before mixing with the lemon juice.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
HOT CHOCOLATE SAUCE FOR ICE CREAM.&#8212;Two cups of light brown sugar, 2 tablespoons of chocolate, &#189; cup sweet milk, butter size of a walnut. Boil until it forms a soft ball when dropped in cold water. Do not beat. Flavor with vanilla and let it stand a moment, pour the sauce on ice cream in the dishes just before serving. Maple sauce is made the same way substituting maple sugar for the brown and omitting the chocolate. Caramel sauce is made by browning sugar in a hot skillet until it melts and smokes and then adding the sweet milk and butter and cooking to soft ball stage. Minced nuts may be sprinkled over the sauce on top of ice cream.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
STRAWBERRY FRAPPE.&#8212;For one quart of ripe berries use four lemons, three cupfuls of sugar and three pints of water. Crush the berries with the sugar, and let them stand an hour before adding the juice of the lemons and the water. Mix well, pour into a freezer and stir for fifteen or twenty minutes. Pack in ice for an hour or two and serve in glasses with or without whipped cream on top.
</p>
<p>
MELON SHERBET.&#8212;Boil one pint of water with half a pound of sugar for twenty minutes, then stir in a little gelatine melted in cold water. Add the strained juice of two lemons, half a pint of melon juice and then the beaten whites of two eggs. Whisk all together and partially freeze.
</p>
<p>
ANGEL FRAPPE.&#8212;Dip half a pound of lump sugar in the strained juice of some white currants and boil them to the "thread" point. Beat the whites of two eggs till stiff, then pour on the sugar and continue beating. Whip a pint of double cream, add a quarter of a pint of currant juice, mix all quickly together and freeze without stirring until nearly solid. Serve in tall glasses with a few white currants in the bottom of each.
</p>
<p>
SHERBET PINEAPPLE.&#8212;Boil together one cup of sugar and one quart of water. Dissolve in one half cup of water one teaspoon of gelatine; juice of two lemons, one can of pinapple. Put in freezer and add one pint of water. When partly frozen add the whites of three eggs and one cup of sugar and finish freezing.&#8212;Mrs. F. Kleinsorge.

STUFFED EGGS.&#8212;Cook eggs twenty minutes just below boiling point. Remove shells, cut in half lengthwise. Take out yolks and mash them. Add one half quantity finely minced ham or chicken, moisten with one tablespoon of butter softened and seasoned with salt, pepper and mustard. Fill whites with this mixture and press halves together. Roll in fine bread crumbs, then into beaten egg and again in crumbs. Fry brown in very hot fat. Serve garnished with parsley.&#8212;Mrs. H. C. Windel.
</p>
<p>
EGGS LYONNAISE.&#8212;Boil eight eggs twenty minutes and throw in cold water and remove shells. Separate yolks and whites and chop whites fine. Put whole yolks in a dish over boiling water to keep warm. Peel and chop two medium sized onions and fry golden brown in two tablespoons of butter. Season with salt, pepper and nutmeg and add a cupful of white sauce. Stir gently to boiling point, then add chopped whites and cook two minutes. Pour over hot whole yolks, sprinkle with minced parsley and serve.&#8212;Mrs. H. C. Windel.
</p>
<p>
HAM AND EGG ON TOAST.&#8212;A good way to use small pieces of left over ham or other cooked meat is to chop them fine. Toast several slices of bread and lay on a platter. Beat three eggs slightly, pour in a little milk, cook over the fire a few minutes, but not till it is thick, stir in the chopped meat and pour over the toast.&#8212;Mrs. Geo. Farries.
</p>
<p>
ONION EGGS.&#8212;Boil six eggs hard, slice three of the eggs, cut three onions in slices, fry in butter, lay them on a platter; place the sliced eggs over them, cover to keep hot, grate the other three eggs, season with salt and pepper, boil up in a little cream and pour over the eggs and onions.&#8212;Mrs. Geo. Farries.
</p>
<p>
SHIRRED EGG.&#8212;Grease a shallow pan and break eggs carefully into it. Sprinkle with salt and pepper and heat with butter. Steam or bake until the whites are set and serve. Shirred eggs are usually served in the individual dishes they are baked in. A little minced parsley is often sprinkled over the top of each plate.
</p>
<p>
LAYER EGGS.&#8212;Fry two onions, sliced thin until they are tender and brown. Cut hard boiled eggs into slices. Add half a bowl of good gravy to the hot onions and then the eggs. Season with salt and pepper and serve.
</p>
<p>
SCRAMBLED EGG.&#8212;(New.) Break eight fresh eggs into a saucepan, add a piece of butter the size of an egg, eight tablespoons of cream; two tablespoons of soup stock, one scant teaspoon of salt and a little pepper. Set over the fire and stir until the eggs begin to thicken then remove from the fire and beat with a Dover beater until they are light and delicate. Heat over the fire again and serve in a warm dish. Very nice for breakfast and lunch.
</p>
<p>
CREAM TOAST WITH EGG.&#8212;Heat a quart of milk; toast slices of bread, butter them and dip each into the milk a second. Lay in a deep serving dish. Now add a tablespoon of butter and a pinch of salt to the hot milk. Beat the yolk of an egg, adding gradually a small tablespoon of flour and two tablespoons of cold milk. Stir into the boiling milk and cook until creamy, then pour it over and around the toast and serve immediately. May be served with poached eggs, too.
</p>
<p>
SCRAMBLED EGGS WITH ASPARAGUS TIPS.&#8212;Beat six eggs a trifle with two tablespoons of cream and scramble in hot pan. Season and stir in the tips of a bunch of stewed asparagus. Add a dash of pepper and serve on toast.
</p>
<p>
EGGS, NEW YORK STYLE.&#8212;Boil six eggs half an hour. Drop them into cold water; shell and quarter them and lay them in a buttered baking dish. Make a white sauce of one pint of hot milk with butter, and flour enough to thicken. Season and stir until smooth. Chop two large boiled onions, add to the sauce and pour over the eggs, sprinkle the top with cracker crumbs, dots of butter and two tablespoons of grated cheese. Bake until a nice brown and serve immediately.
</p>
<p>
CREOLE EGGS.&#8212;Poach eggs in deep, boiling salted water and serve with a highly seasoned tomato sauce.
</p>
<p>
CREAMED EGGS.&#8212;Poach eggs and serve with a thickened, seasoned cream sauce or a browned gravy sauce, mushrooms, asparagus tips, minced parsley or minced cold boiled ham, cauliflower, green corn, oysters, sausage or dried beef may be added to any cream sauce and served over poached eggs or hard boiled eggs, cut into slices or quartered. Or any of these sauces may be spread on an omelet, folded over and served.
</p>
<p>
CHEESE AND EGGS ON TOAST.&#8212;Beat three eggs with three tablespoons of bread crumbs, soaked soft in milk and drained. Add three tablespoons of melted butter, one teaspoon of mustard, salt and pepper and lastly one half pound of grated cheese. Spread evenly on slices of toast and brown quickly in the oven.
</p>
<p>
EGGS AND POTATOES.&#8212;Fry diced cold boiled or baked potatoes brown in a butter, seasoning with salt and pepper; break in three or four eggs and scramble lightly. Add two tablespoons of thick cream and serve immediately.
</p>
<p>
SWISS EGGS.&#8212;Line a pie plate with thin slices of cheese. Mix a cup of milk with one teaspoon of mustard, a dash of cayenne and a little salt. Pour half of this mixture over the cheese. Then break carefully five eggs on the cheese; pour over the rest of the milk and bake until the eggs are set. The cheese will melt and thicken the milk.
</p>
<p>
HONEYCOMB EGGS.&#8212;Set a granite pan with a tablespoon of butter in the oven to heat. Beat five eggs with one third cup of milk and salt and pepper exactly one minute. Pour into the hot pan and bake in a quick oven until eggs rise to the top. Serve immediately.
</p>
<p>
OMELET, NEWPORT STYLE.&#8212;Soak a pint of bread crumbs in one pint of milk. Beat eight eggs very light and stir with the crumbs, beating five minutes. Heat two tablespoons of butter in a pan, pour in the mixture, season with salt and pepper and stir and scramble the mixture quickly with the point of a knife, tossing it lightly. Cook about three minutes and serve on toast.
</p>
<p>
PLAIN OMELET.&#8212;Separate four eggs. Beat the yolks with half a cup of milk or water, season with salt and pepper. Beat the whites in a bowl very light or until the bowl can be inverted and retain the whites of eggs. Cut the whites into the yolks and turn into a hot frying pan with melted butter. Let it stand over the fire undisturbed until it is nicely browned on the bottom. Then run the pan into a hot oven and brown on top. Serve immediately with or without sauce. Vegetable omelet is made by spreading hot thickened creamed vegetables over the omelet just before serving. Asparagus omelet is excellent. Fruit omelets are made by spreading with stewed fruit or jelly or crushed sweetened fresh fruit like strawberries, raspberries or peaches, or jams made of these fruits. Fruit omelets are spread with powdered sugar usually. Rice, macaroni or hominy are often seasoned in a favorite way with cheese or gravy and spread on the omelet before serving. Macaroni cooked with tomatoes and cheese makes an excellent omelet filling. Thickened, stewed tomatoes are nice, and mushrooms may be added with green peas to the tomatoes for Spanish omelet. In fact there are a thousand good combinations and there isn't a nicer way to use a small portion of any left over than to use it for an omelet filling if it will harmonize with eggs at all. Four eggs in an omelet combination of this kind will do nicely for a meal for a family of six people.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
BREAD OMELET.&#8212;Soak one half cup of bread crumbs in one half cup of milk. Separate four eggs, beat separately. Beat bread crumbs into the yolks, add salt and pepper, beat whites till stiff. Add them to yolks stirring with a spoon and pour into a hot spider at once. Cook on top of stove till the bottom is browned then place in the oven till it is cooked through.&#8212;Mrs. Creaser.
</p>
<p>
HAM OR MEAT OMELETS.&#8212;Soak one cupful of bread crumbs in one cup of milk; add one cupful of minced cold boiled ham, veal, beef, corned beef, tongue, fish or chicken; season with salt and pepper. Beat two eggs very light, stir in lightly. Turn into a buttered hot frying pan, brown on the bottom well, then run the pan into a hot oven and brown on top. Or they may be fried in deep lard by dipping a spoonful of the mixture into the smoking hot grease.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CODFISH OMELET.&#8212;Cook one tablespoon of flour with one of butter, add one half cup hot milk. Add one cup of shredded codfish that has been parboiled until tender, and drained. Add two cups cold boiled potatoes that have been chopped fine. Mix well. Brown butter in a hot frying pan, turn in the mixture, brown on the bottom, then fold over and serve.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
BAKED EGGS.&#8212;Break eight eggs into a well buttered dish; salt and pepper them, add bits of butter and four tablespoons of cream; cover top with grated cheese. Bake about twenty minutes.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
EGGS WITH MUSHROOMS ON TOAST.&#8212;Break one cupful of mushrooms into small pieces, dredge them with flour and put them into the saucepan with three tablespoonfuls of butter, a few drops of onion juice, salt and paprika. Cook for ten minutes. Beat three eggs slightly, not separating them, and season them with salt and pepper. Add them to the mushrooms and scrape them from the bottom as they cook until the mixture is thick and creamy. Serve on hot buttered toast.

Canned Fruit, Preserves, Jelly and Wines
</p>
<p class="head">
"Preserving the sweetness of proportion and expressing itself beyond expression."&#8212;Ben Jonson.
</p>
<p>
CANNED BERRIES.&#8212;Fill the glass cans with the cleaned berries as full as you can crowd them in the jars. Make a syrup of sugar and water, allowing a pint of sugar to each pint of water for the sour berries and a quarter less sugar for the sweet fruits. Boil to a medium thick syrup. Fill the cans of fruit with this syrup and seal, but not air tight. (Put the tops lightly on). Stand the jars in a large dish pan or preserving kettle half filled with boiling water. Cover and let the water boil for twenty minutes, then remove the jars and seal as tight as possible. Invert the cans and let them stand over night then place cans each in a paper bag to exclude the light and pack in a cool dry place. It is better to use wash boiler if much fruit is canned at a time and a cloth should be laid on the bottom of the boiler to prevent breaking of the cans. Fruit canned this way retains its shape, color and flavor. Strawberries, cherries, red or black raspberries, black berries, currants, gooseberries, huckleberries, grapes and plums are best canned by this method. If peaches, pineapple, apricots, pears and crab apples are canned this way they should cook twenty minutes longer to assure tender fruit. They are perhaps more satisfactory cooked in a thick syrup in an open kettle and then canned, as they are not soft enough to lose their shape and it is more convenient to test them and judge as to tenderness and flavor.&#8212;Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
BERRY JAM.&#8212;Weight the cleaned berries and take an equal weight of sugar for the sour fruit and crush and beat together until well mixed in the preserving kettle, then boil steadily and gently over the fire until thick, stirring frequently. Gooseberries should be boiled in water to cover until the skins break, then add the sugar slowly and cook half an hour. Currants should be cooked only long enough to let the fruit get tender, as the juice jellies easily anyway, and the currants get hard and tough if cooked too long. Red raspberries are nice combined with currant juice and sugar.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
MARMALADES.&#8212;Marmalade differs from jam because the fruit is cooked in water to cover and when soft and tender is pressed through a colander or sieve. Then the sugar is added and the pulp is cooked to a smooth, thick consistency over a steady fire, stirring often to prevent the fruit from sticking to the kettle. The fruit is weighed before cooking and an equal weight of sugar is used. Fruit "butters" are thick marmalades but they are usually not sweetened as much as marmalades and are cooked longer. Sour fruits like cherries, gooseberries, plums, peach and apples make the best "butters." Black berries, oranges, apricots, grapes, peaches and pears make the best marmalades. The hard seeds of blackberries and grapes are nicely disposed of in marmalade and yet the pulp and fine flavor of the fruit is retained. Cook them as long as you would jelly.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
CURRANT JELLY.&#8212;Wash the currants, steam them and fill a large preserving kettle with two pints of water added. Wash the fruit and boil five minutes. Strain through a jelly bag and measure the juice, allowing a pint of sugar to each pint of juice. Put the juice over the fire and boil steadily twenty minutes. Warm the sugar in the oven, add it to the boiling juice and stir well. Boil three minutes. Try a little on a saucer. If it "jells," pour into jelly glasses, placing a silver spoon in each to prevent cracking the glass. Set in the sun until it is firm, then cover with melted paraffine. Another method is to boil the strained juice ten minutes, then add the sugar and boil ten more minutes. This makes a stiff, firm jelly but the first method makes more delicate jelly. Make grape jelly the same as currant, using green grapes if possible. Grapes must be fresh and not over ripe or they will not "jell" nicely.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
RASPBERRY JELLY.&#8212;Select red raspberries that are firm and if possible, not quite ripe. Set them over a slow fire after crushing them with a potato masher. Boil five minutes, then strain through a jelly bag and measure. Use the same measure of sugar. Boil the juice fifteen minutes, add the sugar and boil five minutes. Or to each three pints of raspberry juice add one pint of currant juice and proceed as for currant jelly. Strawberries are used the same as raspberries, selecting firm, solid fruit that is practically ripened, if possible. It may also be combined with apple juice instead of currant juice, if liked.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
CRAB APPLE JELLY.&#8212;Wash and quarter fresh, firm crab-apples and cover with water allowing one quart of water to each pound of fruit. Cover the kettle and boil twenty minutes. Drain in jelly bag over night. Allow half a pound of sugar to each pint of juice. Boil juice ten minutes, add warm sugar, boil up once and try the jelly, which should jelly instantly.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
WILD PLUM JELLY.&#8212;Sprinkle the washed plums with a little soda; cover with boiling water and stand ten minutes; then drain and cover with fresh boiling water and cook thoroughly, to a mush. Squeeze through a jelly bag and proceed as in making currant jelly. Cultivated plums are cooked in a little water until soft and tender and then strained in a jelly bag and used like currants. Many colors are possible from the different varieties of plums and as many fine flavors.
</p>
<p>
FANCY JELLIES.&#8212;Three pints of pineapple juice to one pint of apple juice and an equal measure of sugar makes nice pineapple jelly. A rose geranium leaf in each glass of apple jelly is liked by many. A delicious mint flavor may be given to apple jelly by lining the bottom of a jelly glass with mint leaves or the juice may be flavored with essence of mint or winter green before it is boiled with the sugar. Even red peppers are boiled in their own juice by chopping them and placing them in a double boiler and cooking until all of the juice is extracted. Allow an equal measure of sugar and boil until it thickens and put in small glasses, and serve with cold meats. The seeds of two vanilla beans added to twelve pounds of apples made into jelly, just before turning the jelly into the tumblers makes a delicious jelly for cake fillings and desserts. Rhubarb, apricots and quinces are sometimes used for jelly but are difficult to make unless combined with other fruits rich in pectose like currants and apples.
</p>
<p>
PLUM CONSERVE.&#8212;Two baskets of blue plums, six large oranges. Use the peeling of two. Two pounds of seeded raisins chopped. Use one half pound of sugar to one pound of fruit. Boil one hour, stirring constantly.&#8212;Mrs. Creaser.
</p>
<p>
CARROT MARMALADE.&#8212;Boil carrots with their skins on. When cooked remove skins and put carrots through a sausage grinder. Take equal amounts by weight of sugar and carrot pulp and boil again. Flavor with sliced lemons and almond extract. Chopped nuts may also be added.&#8212;Mrs. H. Hanson.
</p>
<p>
QUINCE HONEY.&#8212;Grate four large quinces in one quart of cold water. Add two pounds granulated sugar and boil until thick as jam.&#8212;Mrs. W. C. McGuiness.

<p>
QUINCE HONEY.&#8212;To five pounds granulated sugar, add sufficient water to make a syrup, thick enough for pancake syrup. Pare six large quinces and grate them. After the syrup has thoroughly boiled add the grated quinces and boil all together until it becomes a reddish color, when it is ready to be put into jars for use.&#8212;M. E. Cooper.
</p>
<p>
MRS. ALLEMAN'S PINEAPPLE CONSERVE.&#8212;Two pounds of pineapple, four pounds of rhubarb, grind together and add twice as much sugar as you have fruit. Boil slowly until thick then put in jelly glasses. Good with game and cold meats.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
GREEN TOMATO MARMALADE.&#8212;Peel and cut in small pieces six cups of green tomatoes, add two lemons, use the outside yellow, but remove the inside white skin and cut the pulp up in small pieces, add six cups of white sugar and cook until thick.
</p>
<p>
GINGER PEARS.&#8212;Pare and core large juicy pears and cut in small sections. To each quart of the fruit, use one pint of sugar, one piece of ginger root, one stick of cinnamon and one half of a lemon cut in small pieces. Cook very slowly until the pear is clear and the mixture like marmalade.&#8212;Mrs. Schollander.
</p>
<p>
GOOSEBERRY MARMALADE.&#8212;One pound of ripe gooseberries, one half pound of sugar, the shredded peel of one lemon or a stick of cinnamon. Weigh, wash, drain and mash ripe gooseberries. Press through a sieve. Boil the sugar with one half cupful of water and the spice to a syrup; add the sifted gooseberry and cook to a thick marmalade, stirring almost continually. Put up hot in air tight glasses.
</p>
<p>
ORANGE MARMALADE.&#8212;Remove the seeds from&#8212;but do not peel&#8212;twelve large or fifteen small oranges and six lemons. Cut both into thin slices. Pour three quarts of cold water over them and let stand for forty eight hours. Put into a preserving kettle and cook slowly until tender. Add six pounds of sugar; if desired very sweet, add more, and cook until the consistency of ordinary marmalade.
</p>
<p>
ORANGE AND HONEY MARMALADE.&#8212;Peel the oranges, removing every particle of white pith. Cut small; to one quart of this pulp and juice add one pound of honey and one quarter pound of the thin yellow peel of the orange. Cut the peel into tiny bits, cover with half a pint of water and boil until tender; add to the pulp and honey, and cook together for half an hour, stirring frequently. Pour into small glasses and when perfectly cold, cover with paraffin.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
ORANGE HONEY.&#8212;Remove the peel from oranges, and cut into small pieces with a pair of scissors; wash and soak for twenty four hours, then chop fine, and turn into a preserve kettle, using one cupful of sugar, and one cupful of water for every cupful of peel. Boil all together until it is a soft, thick mixture like honey, then bottle in screw top jars. Serve on hot biscuits or rolls, or use like ordinary honey.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
BAR DE LUC CURRANTS.&#8212;Take selected red (or white) currants of large size, one by one, carefully make an incision in the skin one fourth of an inch in size, with tiny embroidery scissors. Through this slit, with a sharp needle, remove the seeds, separately, preserving the shape of the fruit. Take the weight of the currants in strained honey and, when hot, add the currants. Let simmer a minute or two, then seal as jelly. The currants retain their shape, are of a beautiful color and melt in the mouth. Should the currant liquify the honey too much, carefully skim them out, reduce the syrup at a gentle simmer to desired consistency and store as before after adding the fruit.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
SWEET PICKLE OF PINEAPPLE.&#8212;Peel a pineapple, removing the eyes. Tear the fruit from the core with a silver fork. For six pounds of fruit boil together a pint of vinegar and three pounds of sugar. Put into the vinegar a bag containing two level teaspoons each of powdered cinnamon and mace, half a teaspoon of cloves and a piece of green ginger root about a half inch long. When scalding pour over the fruit, which should be in a large crock or earthen dish. Let all stand for twenty four hours, drain off the syrup, bring it to the boiling point and pour over the fruit. Repeat for two more successive days, then seal.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
SUN PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES.&#8212;Select ripe, clean, perfect fruit. It spoils the fruit to wash it; if, however, this is necessary, put about one quart of berries in a wire basket or colander; put them carefully down in a pan of cold water; move the basket gently just a moment; lift and drain; then stem the berries. Weigh, and to each pound allow one pound of sugar. Select large stoneware or granite platters; heat them quite hot; cover with half an inch sugar, a layer of strawberries, and the remaining sugar over the top of the berries. Stand the platters in a "cold frame", or cover them with glass and stand them in the hot sun. As soon as the sun becomes too cool bring them in; don't lift the covers, but stand them aside until morning. Next morning put them out in the hot sun again. By this time the berries should be soft and transparent, but perfectly whole and of a brilliant color. Lift each berry carefully with a fork; put it in the tumbler; fill all the necessary tumblers and cover them for a moment with glass. Put the syrup over the fire and boil rapidly until it is sufficiently reduced just to cover the fruit; pour it over the fruit while it is hot; protect the tumblers and stand them aside to cool. When cold put over the top of each a tablespoonful of melted paraffin; cover the tops of the tumblers with two thicknesses of tissue paper and fasten firmly around the edge with library paste. When the paper is thoroughly dry brush it with cold water. In drying the paper will tighten and form an exceedingly good covering.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
APPLE BUTTER.&#8212;Boil cider down to two thirds its original quantity, and turn into this as many peeled and sliced apples as the liquid will cover. Simmer, stirring often until soft and broken. Strain out the cooked apples, add more fresh ones and cook in the same way. Do this until the cider is absorbed. Set all aside in a stone crock for twelve hours, then boil to a soft brown mass and pack in stone jars.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
CANNED WHOLE GOOSEBERRIES.&#8212;Take stem and blossom ends from large firm gooseberries. Fill fruit can with them, cover with boiling water, let stand until following day; drain, add boiling water again repeating for three days in succession. Then fill with boiling water and seal. When ready to use cook and sweeten. Fine for winter pies.
</p>
<p>
SUNNED CURRANTS.&#8212;Cover large red, stemmed currants with granulated sugar; spread on a platter and stand over night. Cover with a pane of glass and stand in the sun three days in succession. Seal in jelly glasses. Use equal weights of sugar and fruit. Same recipe is nice with red raspberries and with large, firm strawberries. The juice jellies around the fruit which retains its shape and rich color.
</p>
<p>
CANNED GRAPE JUICE.&#8212;Stem, wash and drain concord grapes, cook until soft; strain through jelly bag. Add a pint of sugar to each gallon of juice. Cook only until sugar is dissolved and seal.
</p>
<p>
PEACH PRESERVES.&#8212;Use four cups of sugar to each quart of peeled peaches. Make a thick syrup of the sugar and water. Pour hot over fruit and stand over night. Drain syrup and boil thick again. Drop in peaches and cook tender. Pack them in jars, covering with the syrup.
</p>
<p>
CHOKE CHERRY AND CRAB APPLE JELLY.&#8212;Cover choke cherries with water and stew until soft. Strain through jelly bag. Prepare crab apples likewise. Use twice as much apple juice as cherry. Mix and boil twenty five minutes. Add one cup sugar to each cup juice and boil ten minutes more.
</p>
<p>
SUN PRESERVED STRAWBERRIES.&#8212;Wash and stem berries. Take an equal weight of sugar, add a very little water and dissolve. When boiling add the berries. Let come to a boil and cook three minutes. Pour into platters or shallow dishes and set in the sun until thick. Three days will suffice if the weather is clear. If the dishes are covered with glass the fruit cooks more quickly. When thick put in tumblers, cover with paraffin and put in a dark place.
</p>
<p>
CONSERVES.&#8212;One quart of rhubarb (do not peel), one pint of red raspberries, one pint red currants, one pound raisins, one pound English walnuts, two oranges (sliced very thin), two lemons (sliced very thin); a pound of sugar to a pound of fruit. Cook until thick as jelly. Put in jelly glasses and cover with paraffin. (Delicious.)
</p>
<p>
APPLE BUTTER.&#8212;Fill a preserve kettle with peeled, cored and sliced apples. Add a slight flavoring of cloves, allspice and cinnamon. Cover with fresh, sweet cider and boil slowly, stirring frequently until the whole becomes a dark brown jam with only juice enough to keep it soft and buttery. Remove from fire and place in covered jars or seal. Do not use for several weeks. Good spread for bread for children. Select firm apples that cook to a soft, smooth apple sauce. Bell-flowers, Greenings, Baldwin or Maiden Blush apples make good apple butter.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
CURRANT COMPOTE.&#8212;Pick nice large red currants from stems after washing well. Put one half of them into a preserve kettle. Press juice out of remaining half; add enough sugar to make a syrup, heat until sugar is dissolved. Cool slightly and pour over the currants in preserve kettle. Bring to a boil and seal in pint jars. The currants will be whole and taste much like fresh fruit with jellied juice around them.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.

GRAPE WINE.&#8212;For five gallons of wine use twelve and one half pounds of concord grapes, twelve and one half pounds of wild grapes, twelve and one half pounds sugar. Wash the grapes then pick from stems and put in stone jars and mash; let stand from seven to ten days, then press through wine press or jelly bag. Add sugar and water enough to fill a five gallon keg. Put in cool cellar; let bung hole remain open but cover it with cheese cloth and let grapes ferment; change cloth frequently and after six weeks cork the keg tightly and let lie until March, then seal in bottles. May be made from bull berries or other fruit by same process. Same recipe for choke cherries.&#8212;Mrs. J. Bruegger.
</p>
<p>
RHUBARB WINE.&#8212;Take five pounds of rhubarb and cut into small pieces, add one gallon of cold water and put in a crock for eight days, stirring it well two or three times a day, then strain and to every gallon add four pounds of white sugar, the juice and half the rind of one lemon. Dissolve half an ounce of gelatine in a little of the liquid and add. Cover it for a month, then strain through a muslin bag and bottle.&#8212;Mrs. Schollander.
</p>
<p>
CHOKE CHERRY WINE.&#8212;To one gallon of fruit allow two gallons of water, mash fruit to get the juice, let stand nine days, then press through a fruit press. When the juice is all extracted strain through a cloth. To each gallon of juice allow three pounds of granulated sugar, or loaf sugar, let stand several days and when thoroughly mixed, the sugar all dissolved, strain through flannel bag, into keg or jug, leaving it uncorked, but should be covered with some perforated cover or cloth to avoid dirt or flies, or anything to get into the keg. Let this ferment until it stops, which takes several weeks and be sure to keep it full, there is always loss when it bubbles over, therefore it is advisable to reserve a quart of juice to fill up with (plain sugar water will answer the same purpose). When it ceases to ferment cork tight, (air tight), let alone until the month of March then draw into bottles, cork tight and it will be ready for use.&#8212;Mrs. George Bruegger.

Salads
</p>
<p>
FRUIT SALADS.&#8212;There is a large variety of dressings considered appropriate for fruit salads. Boiled frosting is perhaps one of the most popular foundations with varying flavors of fruit, wine, etc. Sugar and lemon juice, sugar and fruit juice, boiled custard, plain whipped cream sweetened and flavored, are all used, as well as a cooked dressing made in this way: Add to the yolks of four eggs well beaten, two tablespoonfuls of sugar, one tablespoonful of butter, one half teaspoonful of salt, a pinch of cayenne and four tablespoonfuls of vinegar. Cook in a double boiler, stir constantly and cook rather slowly to prevent curdling. Let this get thoroughly cold and just before serving add one pint of whipped cream unsweetened. Mix well and pour over the salad.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
GOLDEN DRESSING.&#8212;Beat two eggs, and a quarter cupful of any light colored fruit juice, quarter cupful lemon juice, and a quarter cupful of sugar. Put in a double boiler, stir until thickened, cool and pour over sliced fruit.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
FRUIT SALAD.&#8212;For the salad itself all sorts of combinations are possible. Malaga grapes cut in halves, seeded, and mixed with a third of the same quantity of shelled pecans in one happy mixture. Pineapples, oranges and bananas go well together, as also pitted ripe sour cherries with nuts. Orange, lettuce, lemon, nuts and water cress are congenial companions, while preserved fruit may be used with fresh fruit. Prunes are delicious in a salad, stuffing them with nuts or cheese, covering with mayonnaise. The prunes should be washed, soaked over night, then cooked until tender before they are pitted. Apricots, either fresh or canned, sliced ripe pears are two new favorites used with nuts and served with a nice boiled salad dressing, and garnished with shredded lettuce.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
FROZEN SALAD.&#8212;Put into a bowl one cupful orange slices, one cupful each bananas and pineapple, one cupful of mayonnaise, one cupful cream, measured before whipping, and a teaspoonful gelatine that has been softened in cold water, then dissolve over hot water, toss lightly, place in a mould and freeze. When frozen, cut in slices and serve on lettuce leaves.&#8212;Contributed.
</p>
<p>
PINEAPPLE SALAD.&#8212;Lay one thick slice of canned pineapple on a lettuce leaf, spread with thick mayonnaise, cap with sweetened whipped cream and sprinkle with ground pecans or English walnuts.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
FRUIT SALAD.&#8212;One cup of diced apples, one cup diced pineapple, one cup diced oranges, one and one half cups bananas, one cup white grapes, (cut in half), seeds removed, one half cup walnut meats, one half cup diced celery. Serve with a salad dressing or whipped cream.&#8212;Mrs. Aaron J. Bessie.
</p>
<p>
MRS. ALLEMAN'S WALDORF SALAD.&#8212;One cup each of chopped apples, walnuts and celery. Dress with following mayonnaise dressing: Mix one half tablespoon salt, one half tablespoon mustard and three fourths of a tablespoon of sugar, add one slightly beaten egg, two and one half tablespoons of melted butter, three fourths of a cup of thin cream and very slowly one fourth of a cup of vinegar. Cook in double boiler until thick, then strain and cool.
</p>
<p>
FRUIT SALAD.&#8212;One pound of malaga grapes, washed, cut into halves and seeded; six large slices of canned pineapple cut into small pieces; four apples peeled, quartered and cut into small pieces; three bananas sliced fine; one bunch of celery, cleaned and cut into small dice; one cupful of chopped pecans or English walnuts. Mix all lightly together and mix with mayonnaise salad dressing. As all people do not like olive oil I usually make a boiled dressing as follows: Heat half a cupful of vinegar with as much hot water and two large spoonfuls of butter. Beat the yolks of four eggs very light with a scant half a cupful of sugar; add one level teaspoonful of flour and stir well; add then one tablespoonful of dry mustard, one teaspoonful of salt and one of celery salt or celery seed; a dash of black and of red pepper, beat a little; place over the fire and cook thick, beating well. Cook only a few moments, then remove from the fire and beat until perfectly smooth. When ready to use add one cupful of thick whipped cream. Mix with the prepared fruit. A scant teaspoon of flour added to sugar and egg mixture prevents curdling of the dressing and saves eggs at a season when they are scarce while it assures a smooth dressing always. A dash of sugar added to cream before whipping it will prevent its turning to butter. Lemon juice sprinkled over the fruit will prevent discoloring of apples and bananas.&#8212;Mrs. B. G. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
BANANA SALAD.&#8212;Skin bananas and cut into halves. Roll each in chopped peanuts. Lay on a lettuce leaf and serve with mayonnaise dressing capped with whipped cream.&#8212;Contributed.

<p>
SERVING A FORMAL DINNER.&#8212;In cities the usual hour for a dinner party is seven o'clock; in country places it is frequently earlier in the day. When the last guest has arrived, dinner is announced. The host leads the way with the lady whom he wishes to honor and the hostess comes last with the gentleman whom she wishes to honor. The giving of a dinner is the most important of all the duties of a hostess. She must not betray ignorance or show nervousness, for she alone is responsible for its entire success. The serving maid should be trained to keep cool and avoid accidents. The number invited and the outlay expended should depend upon circumstances and one's means. The favorite form of serving a formal dinner is called a la Russe. The articles of food are carved by the servants at a side table or in the kitchen and brought to the guests. This has one advantage; it allows the host and hostess more time for social enjoyment with their guests. But it calls for well trained servants to perform this duty satisfactorily. It requires about one servant to every six guests; therefore, when dinner is served in this fashion, where the help is inadequate, it is well to engage outside assistance. For a home like, informal, dinner, where the host does the carving, one servant can wait upon twelve persons and do it well if properly trained. On a table or sideboard should be placed the plates for the various courses, smaller spoons, finger-bowls, coffee cups and saucers. As the plates from each course are removed, they should be taken to the kitchen. The waiter should approach the guests from the left except in serving water, coffee, or anything of a like nature. The color and flavor of the various courses should be as different from each other as possible, offering all the foods in their respective seasons and of the finest quality.
</p>
<p>
COURSES FOR A FORMAL DINNER.&#8212;First course: Oysters, as a rule, should be served at the beginning of a dinner, though they are used only in those months of the year in which the letter "r" occurs. The balance of the year little neck clams are used. The second course consists of a soup, the clear soup being preferred, accompanied by crackers or bread. Celery may be served also. The third course consists of fish, boiled or fried, and should be accompanied by small boiled potatoes; if boiled or cooked in any fancy manner, serve radishes. Fourth course: An entree is next in order if desired; it should be made in a fancy way, so as to avoid carving; bread should be the accompaniment. Relishes, such as olives, salted almonds, etc., are served with this course. The fifth course consists of roasts. These may be composed of beef, veal, mutton, lamb, venison, turkey, duck, goose, or capon, accompanied by one or two vegetables. Sixth course: Punch or sherbet may be dispensed with or not, as fancy dictates. The seventh course consists of snipe, prairie chicken, squabs, etc., but poultry, such as spring chicken, or duck, may be served instead. Eighth course: Any appetizing salad with cheese wafers. Ninth course: Hot and cold sweet dishes, consisting of puddings, ice cream, cakes, etc. Tenth course: Turkish or black coffee served demi-tasse. The above makes a pleasant menu, but it can be made simpler or more elaborate as one chooses. Before serving the dessert all the dishes should be removed, save the drinking: glasses, and all crumbs should be lifted from the cloth by means of the crumb knife and tray. A dessert plate and dessert spoon and knife provided they are needed, should then be placed in front of each guest. Coffee (made after the manner of after dinner coffee) should be passed last, demi-tasse, and served clear. Sugar and cream should follow, in order that those who prefer either or both, may help themselves as they please.

<p>
Fish may be scaled more quickly if dipped in boiling water for a moment.
</p>
<p>
Do not wash meats in water, wipe them with a wet cloth.
</p>
<p>
The whites of eggs will whip more readily if a pinch of salt is added to them. If the eggs are placed in cold water for a time before being broken, they will whip easily.
</p>
<p>
A small quantity of soda, stirred into milk or cream, will keep it from souring in hot weather.
</p>
<p>
A few drops of lemon juice added to the water in which potatoes are boiled will prevent the potatoes turning dark when cooked.
</p>
<p>
In mixing liquids with salads, add the liquid to the salad by degrees. They will blend more readily.
</p>
<p>
To preserve the color of green vegetables put them on to cook in boiling water with a pinch of soda; or, keep the cover off the kettle while boiling them.
</p>
<p>
If you use too much salt by mistake add a trifle of sugar or a vinegar, according to the dish. This will counteract the salty taste.

Measuring Hints
</b>
</p>
<p>
A cupful of liquid means all the cup will hold.
</p>
<p>
A spoonful of liquid is all the spoon will hold.
</p>
<p>
Salt, flour, seasoning spices, butter and all salads are measured level.
</p>
<p>
To measure a level spoonful, dip the spoon into the dry material, taking up a heaping spoonful, then level it off even with the edge of the spoon with a knife.
</p>
<p>
To measure a part of a spoonful, cut lengthwise of the spoon for the half and crosswise for the quarter.
</p>
<p>
A tablespoonful of butter should be measured before melting.
</p>
<p>
A tablespoonful of melted butter should be measured after being melted.
</p>
<p>
Measure a cupful of cream before it is whipped.
</p>
<p>
Measure a cupful of whipped cream after it is whipped.
</p>
<p>
Always sift flour, salt, baking powder, spices, powdered sugar and soda before measuring. If measured in a solid state before sifting much more than the quantity called for will be used.
</p>
<p>
When ice is not to be had, half fill a large flat bottomed bowl with cold water. Set in this the vessels containing milk, butter, sauces, etc. Cover with napkins which dip down into the water and set the whole thing in a draft. Evaporation will keep everything sweet and cool.
</p>
<p>
Fruit cake recipes usually call for dried currants. These are hard and lack flavor. Try using an equal measure of chopped prunes. They hold moisture and impart a delicious flavor to the cake.
</p>
<p>
Use a large sponge for general house cleaning instead of a brush. It gets a good grip on the dirt and is not so sloppy.
</p>
<p>
Silver may be cleaned by laying in a pan of sour milk for several hours then washed and wiped dry.
</p>
<p>
Keep lemons in cold water. Change every few days.

Notes
</b>
</p>
<p>
A little sugar added to cream before whipping will prevent it from turning to butter.
</p>
<p>
Use scant measure of sugar in custard pie and do not cook after the custard is set sufficiently to cut with a silver knife, if you want a smooth and palatable baked custard.
</p>
<p>
A small dish of water placed in the oven will prevent scorched or burned food when the oven is hotter than it should be.
</p>
<p>
Save bread crusts and dry them in the warming closet of the kitchen range, to roll fine for a coating for fried oysters, croquettes and cutlets. Dried crumbs are better for dressing and puddings also.
</p>
<p>
Drop a few slices of raw potatoes in the hot lard used for frying doughnuts to clarify the grease before putting it away for future use.

Laundry Work
</p>
<p>
In laundry work different methods must be used for different fabrics. The texture and color of a garment must be considered before method of laundering is decided on. As laundry is the heaviest part of house work one should carefully consider all means by which strength may be saved. A careful sorting of all clothes. Thorough soaking of all articles that will not be injured thereby. A generous use of good soap and a well equipped room for laundry purposes with plenty of good soft water will to some extent lighten the labor. Chemicals judicially used have been found helpful. A good solution for loosening dirt and may be used in soaking the different kinds of clothes including prints and flannels is given out and recommended by the Agricultural school of Minnesota. It is made as follows: Procure 10 cents worth of salts of tartar, 10 cents worth of crystal ammonia, one can of Lewis lye. Dissolve all in a gallon of warm but not boiling water and cork tightly. When wanted for use a teacupful of the mixture for from three to four pailsful warm water will be the right amount to use when soaking clothes.

</p>
<p>
Use warm water to sprinkle your starched clothes.
</p>
<p>
Fine ginghams and percales dipped in sweet milk instead of starch, gives them that dainty, glossy dressing they have when new.
</p>
<p>
Ink Stains&#8212;Soak in sour milk. If a dark stain remains, rinse in a weak solution of chloride of lime.
</p>
<p>
Blood Stains&#8212;Soak in cold salt water then wash in warm water with plenty of soap, afterward boil.
</p>
<p>
Grass Stains&#8212;Saturate the spot thoroughly with kerosene, then put them in the washtub.
</p>
<p>
Iodine Stains&#8212;Wash with alcohol, then rinse in soapy water.
</p>
<p>
Hot Tea and Coffee Stains&#8212;Soak the stained fabric in cold water; wring; spread out and pour a few drops of glycerine on each spot. Let it stand several hours; then wash with cold water and soap.
</p>
<p>
Iron Rust&#8212;Soap the stain thoroughly with lemon juice; sprinkle with salt and bleach for several hours in the sun.
</p>
<p>
Grease Spots&#8212;Hot water and soap generally remove these. If fixed by long standing, use ether, chloroform or naptha. All three of these must be used away from fire or artificial light.
</p>
<p>
Mildew&#8212;Soak in a weak solution of chloride of lime for several hours. Rinse in cold water.
</p>
<p>
Sewing Machine Oil Stains&#8212;Rub with lard. Let stand for several hours, then wash with cold water and soap.
</p>
<p>
Scorch Stains&#8212;Wet the scorched place, rub with soap and bleach in the sun.
</p>
<p>
Fruit Stains&#8212;Stretch the fabric containing the stain over the mouth of a basin and pour boiling water on the stain. In cold weather fruit spots can frequently be removed by hanging the stained garments out of doors over night. If the stain has been fixed by time soak the article in a weak solution of oxalic acid or hold the spot over the fumes of sulphur.
</p>
<p>
Here is an excellent cleansing fluid that will leave no rings or water lines: One pint of benzine, an ounce of ether and an ounce of chloroform. Shake well before using and keep tightly corked. An absorbent pad (white blotting paper or thick towel) should be placed beneath the material. Apply cleanser with a soft linen cloth and rub stain lightly until it disappears. Beware of fire.
</p>
<p>
Cover the grass stains with common black molasses&#8212;the thickest you can get&#8212;and rub it in with the finger until the fabric is saturated. Leave it on for a day and wash out with clear water. A homely but an effectual process.
</p>
<p>
For a rust stain, wet the spot and cover with oxalic acid, rub it in well, and then wash off with clean, tepid water.
</p>
<p>
Soak the white articles in sour milk or in buttermilk all night. Rinse in the morning and sun all day, wetting hourly with cream of tartar water. Rinse again in the evening and repeat the soaking. If one trial does not wholly remove the mildew, repeat the process.
</p>
<p>
REVIVING BLACK DRESSES.&#8212;Wash black cashmere, mohair, voile or other black dress goods, in soap suds until clean, then rinse well. Put bluing into water enough to cover the cloth well until it looks almost black. Put in the cloth and rinse it about in the water, then be sure it is all under water and leave it over night. Lift from this bluing water directly to the line without wringing and let hang until almost dry, then press on the wrong side on an entirely smooth ironing sheet.
</p>
<p>
TO LAUNDER A BLACK COTTON DRESS.&#8212;Black and white or all black muslin dresses seldom look well when they come from the laundry and black cotton does not appear to make a good "tub" dress. But if the following method is tried it will give the cotton a clear look and stiffness like new. Mix one half cup of flour with cold water to make smooth, then turn on two quarts of boiling water and cook five minutes. Add this starch, to enough warm water to wash the dress or waist in and wash the garment without using a particle of soap. Rinse in two waters and hang to dry. Just before ironing sprinkle on the wrong side.
</p>
<p>
REMEDY FOR PALLOR.&#8212;An excellent lotion in case of pallor is made from one tablespoon of tincture of benzoin and three ounces of rose water.
</p>
<p>
EGGS PRESERVED IN WATER GLASS.&#8212;(Silicate of Sodine.) By this method eggs may be kept fresh for eight months if rules are carefully followed. Boil a quantity of water and allow it to cool. Use one gallon of water and one quart of water glass and stir until thoroughly mixed. Use a glazed stone jar and deposit the eggs into the solution and see that the eggs are covered to the depth of at least an inch. The jar must be covered and stored in a cold place. The eggs must be perfectly fresh and best results are obtained if they are put in the solution as gathered from the nests each day. The shells must also be perfectly clean.&#8212;Mrs. Harry Hansen.
</p>
<p>
WASHING FLUID.&#8212;This fluid is guaranteed not to injure or take the color out of any fabric and may be used in soaking white clothes, prints and flannels. It is made and used as follows: Heat one gallon of water. Add one can Lewis lye, ten cents worth of crystal ammonia and ten cents worth of salts of tartar. Have water hot but not boiling and cork solution in a gallon jug. A teacupful to three or four pails of hot water is the amount needed in soaking soiled clothes.&#8212;Mrs. Harry Hansen.

</p>
<p>
LINSEED POULTICE.&#8212;Four ounces linseed meal and ten ounces of boiling water. Mix gradually. Dip spoon in boiling water when you spread this mixture on the poultice cloth. Bind on inflamed parts.
</p>
<p>
MUSTARD POULTICE.&#8212;Two ounces of dry mustard mixed with the whites of two eggs to a paste. Spread on a cloth in a thick paste and apply while it is fresh and wet.
</p>
<p>
COLDS.&#8212;For a cold in the head just appearing inhale spirits of camphor. Put one or two drops of camphor on a small lump of sugar, dissolve in a wine glass of water, (one gill) and take a teaspoonful every half hour. Take a good cathartic or drink four or five glasses of hot water at bed time and in half an hour follow with four more glasses of hot water. Gargle sore throat with warm water and alcohol or warm water and salt using one level teaspoon of salt to a pint of water. If cold has made the throat or lungs sore, dip a cloth in cold water, wring dry and spread it on throat or chest. Cover with three thicknesses of dry flannel and bind it on securely. Take a hot foot bath and go to bed. This treatment should cure your cold. If is doesn't it will be a wise thing to call a physician in the morning before alarming symptoms are developed. Bathe frequently, drink plenty of water and keep the bowels in regular action and prevent colds.
</p>
<p>
TO REDUCE SWELLINGS.&#8212;Tincture of arnica or witch hazel applied to a bump on the head or a bruise where the skin is not broken brings relief from pain and often prevents inflammation and bad swellings.
</p>
<p>
CUTS AND SCRATCHES.&#8212;Apply peroxide to cuts, scratches and all bruises where the skin is broken. This remedy often serves as a preventative to blood poisoning.
</p>
<p>
WHEN A BUTTON IS SWALLOWED.&#8212;Children sometimes swallow buttons, fruit stones, thimbles and pennies. When the mother is sure that the child has swallowed a foreign substance the child should be encouraged and even compelled to eat plentifully of mashed potatoes, thick mush and coarse bread. Then follow with syrup of rhubarb or castor oil. Do not give the cathartic immediately on finding out the accident but make sure that much bulky food is taken. Give a child slippery elm to chew when it swallows a penny or button or hard object. This forms a slippery coating on the surface of the penny in the stomach which aids it in passing easily through the intestine and prevents its lodging there and was the remedy applied by a physician when called.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
CRAMPS IN THE LEG.&#8212;Sleep with hot water bag at the feet. A garter tied tightly around the leg often effects a cure. Quick, hard rubbing is best in sudden, painful attacks. Often it is essential to walk about the room to bring the circulation of blood to the feet again.
</p>
<p>
INSECT BITES.&#8212;A teaspoonful of tincture of wild rosemary to a glass of water. Apply this lotion frequently to the inflamed parts.
</p>
<p>
GOOD LINIMENT.&#8212;One ounce of camphor, four ounces olive oil. Dissolve the gum in the oil and add one quarter of an ounce of chloroform. Shake well and apply to affected parts. This is for external use only.
</p>
<p>
CURE FOR HICCOUGHS.&#8212;Lump of sugar saturated with vinegar will usually cure hiccoughs in a child. Drink of water often brings immediate relief. In prolonged cases of hiccoughing, weak, hot coffee with cream and sugar given at frequent intervals has cured the patient.
</p>
<p>
NOSE BLEED.&#8212;Snuff powdered alum up the nose. This alum is also good for checking hemorrhage, sometimes caused by extracting teeth. Fill the cavity with the alum. Apply cold salt water to bleeding nose if you haven't alum.
</p>
<p>
CORNS.&#8212;Bind bread soaked in vinegar on the corns day and night and they will come out by the roots.
</p>
<p>
WARTS.&#8212;Prick with a needle (sterilized by boiling in clear water for ten minutes) until the wart bleeds then apply soda.
</p>
<p>
BUNIONS.&#8212;Pulverize salt petre and sweet oil mixed well and applied to the sore joints often brings relief. Bunions are usually caused by wearing shoes too short.
</p>
<p>
SUMMER COMPLAINT OR DIARRHOEA.&#8212;In early stages unless alarming symptoms appear, give the child or patient a generous dose of castor oil and keep patient on a light diet for a day or two or refrain from eating at all for twelve hours. If passages are green and full of mucous membrane call a physician immediately as delay may be fatal. Whites of two eggs mixed with a little water sipped frequently is often healing also to stomach and bowels.
</p>
<p>
GOOD WAY TO GIVE CASTOR OIL.&#8212;Put a tablespoon of orange juice into a small tumbler, pour in the required amount of oil, and more orange juice on top. The oil forms a ball in the middle of the juice and is swallowed without coming in contact with the tongue. Wine may be used instead of orange juice.
</p>
<p>
BURNS.&#8212;Grated raw peeled potatoes spread on bandages and bound on a badly burned arm, shoulder and hand brought immediate relief to one of my children once when I was on a farm and could not get a doctor. I kept the bandages moist by binding fresh new, wet ones over the old ones until pain ceased but did not remove the dressing at all until wound was healed. It healed perfectly without leaving any scar. Do not know the merits of this remedy from a physician's standpoint but it was used successfully in a bad hotel fire in a village where no physicians resided and the patients all recovered from severe burns and there were no scars left on their bodies.&#8212;Mrs. Whitehead.
</p>
<p>
LOCK UP POISONS.&#8212;All poisons should be labeled and kept in a compartment by themselves. Such household remedies as laudenum, chloroform, arsenic, aconite belladona, cough medicine, carbolic acid, headache pellets or powders, linaments, opiates, fly poison, etc., should be kept in a locked box or in a covered can labeled "poison" placed out of the reach of children. They should always be kept separate from all other medicine. "An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure." Many deaths are caused by carelessness in placing poisonous remedies within the reach of children. Unless poison can be kept in a safe place, it is wiser always to throw it in the fire or to bury it&#8212;and buy a new supply when needed than to run the risk of poisoning a member of the family. Always look at the label on a bottle before taking any medicine.
</p>
<p>
TOOTH ACHE.&#8212;Chloroform and clove oil applied with a piece of absorbent cotton to the cavity of an aching tooth brings immediate relief.
</p>
<p>
CROUP.&#8212;Lard or goose grease and turpentine applied freely to the throat and chest. Hot steam inhaled from a sponge dipped in boiling water makes breathing easier. In serious cases an antiseptic should be given to produce vomiting immediately until the physician arrives. Give castor oil to a child showing symptoms of a croupy cough.

The Difference In</big></b>
</p>
<p class="ctr">
<b>
<big>
Sewing Machines</big></b>
</p>
<p class="narrow">
It is a mistaken idea that sewing machines are pretty much alike, when as a matter of fact there is a vast difference.
</p>
<p class="narrow">
There is but one machine that sews better than any other&#8212;and that one is the Singer.
</p>
<p class="narrow">
This is because the Singer idea is distinctive&#8212;every year shows improvement in that idea.
</p>
<p class="narrow">
This is because the Singer factories are not only equipped with tools and machinery better calculated to make good sewing machines than any other, but this equipment is unique and not to be found elsewhere.
</p>
<p class="narrow">
This is because a half century has been devoted to training and specializing men each to do one thing best in sewing machine construction. The Singer's superiority&#8212;its lifetime-lasting value&#8212;does not appear on the surface.
</p>
<p class="narrow">
One machine does sew better than any other&#8212;and that one is the Singer.

we carry a splendid line of knives and forks, spoons, carving sets, etc. You couldn't find a finer assortment if you tried a month. And even if you found as fine, you would have to pay a much higher price than we ask. Moral: Buy here and save time, trouble and money.
